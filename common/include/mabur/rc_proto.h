// bytes as of RC_VERSION 2, pinned by the goldens in tests/test_rc.cpp.
// All multi-byte fields are little-endian; every frame ends with a u16
// CRC16-CCITT (mabur::crc16_ccitt) over every byte before it.

// control was deleted. Spec 2026-08-12-constant-txpower-design.md.
// Bumped 2 -> 3 on 2026-08-15: RCF lost ack_seq, score and the
// n_layers + layer_delivery tail. maburd read none of the three (rc_agent.cpp
// uses vtx_id/seq/profile/fec_overhead/probe and nothing else), so they were
// write-only ballast; the RCF head is fixed-length now.
// Bumped 3 -> 4 on 2026-08-29: fec_overhead is now the literal air overhead
// in x100 encoding (was a x16 'cmd' scalar the drone scaled 2x); Telem
// applied_ov split per stream; probe flag renamed — the fixed base=mcs−1
// rule means both ends of v4 agree on the split with no extra bytes. Spec
// 2026-08-29-airtime-balance-uep.
// Bumped 4 -> 5 on 2026-08-30: fec_overhead split into per-stream
// fec_overhead_base/fec_overhead_enh (fixed per-rung pairs replace the
// balancer; base rides the scored mcs — same-rate). Spec
// 2026-08-30-same-rate-fixed-pairs-design.md.

// CAP_ENH_PROBE are gone. Spec 2026-09-04-probe-stream-design.md.
