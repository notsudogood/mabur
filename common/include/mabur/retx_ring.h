// Fixed-slot ring of sealed source envelopes keyed by wire seq (spec
// 2026-10-05 fec-nack §4.1). Single writer (the drone hot thread), any
// reader (the RX thread answering a T_NACK). No lock: each slot carries a
// seqlock-style state word; a reader that catches a slot mid-write, or a
// slot that was overwritten under it, gets `false` and treats it as a miss.
