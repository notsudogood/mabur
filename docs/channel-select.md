# Auto channel selection over a shared channel set

The operator sets nothing about channels on either end. Both ends carry
the same **channel set** (`radio.channels`); the drone always sits on
exactly one member and remembers which; the GS is always on one member
(`op`), remembers which, and knows the set is the only place the drone can
be. With `[radio] channel = "auto"` the GS measures the set once, at
process start, and moves the link to the cleanest member (the **boot
hop**), then freezes for good — later link losses re-propose the same
frozen pick and the scout never runs again. A healthy link never moves on
its own; in auto mode the sub-second reactive layer
(`docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`) still handles an interfered channel after
the freeze. `channel = <member>` pins the link there: no measurement **and
no reactive hop** — the pin is static (since 2026-10-04; before that a dirty
pin hopped away on `hop.enable`, which is deleted). A drone found off the
pin is still relocated to it.

**There is no home channel.** The 2026-09-13 design (candidates plus a
privileged home, boot-only pick frozen at first ack, split/reunite on link
loss) is superseded by this one, shipped 2026-10-03. Everything below
describes what shipped; the parts of the old design that are unchanged in
spirit (ack-then-move, the silent dwell, the leak subtraction) carry
forward, renamed to fit the new model.

Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-auto-channel-set-design.md`
(gitignored — this page is the durable record, and where the two disagree
this page describes what shipped). Builds on
`docs/inflight-channel-hop.md` (2026-09-14), which stays as the reactive
layer and needed its own home references removed to match (see that
page's §1/§3/§5/§7).

## Config

Both ends carry the set. The drone's list may be a superset of the GS's,
never a subset: the GS only ever proposes or orders members, and the drone
parks only on members. If the drone's set does not contain the GS's, the
link may never form (a drone parked on a channel the GS never searches is
never found) or never reach the pick (the drone ignores a hop order to a
channel outside its set, so every relocation fails).

**The default set `[40, 64, 112, 144]` is provisional** until bench
row 8 (`maburcal` on 64 and 112; swap 64 for 128 if it fails) — the
spec's calibration gate for the members that have never been
wall-calibrated. Both bundles carry the same note (final review I4,
2026-10-04).

GS, `gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`:

```toml
[radio]
channels = [40, 64, 112, 144]   # the set; the drone parks on a member, the GS picks among them
channel  = "auto"               # or a member: pin the link there, no measurement
width    = 40
tx_card  = -1
relays   = []

[radio.scan]
dwell_ms        = 250   # measurement observe per 20 MHz half (unchanged)
settle_ms       = 30    # after every retune (unchanged)
min_rounds      = 3     # full passes before the ranking is mature (unchanged)
search_ms       = 100   # DISC burst at the start of every unlinked dwell on a primary (5 beacon periods)
op_window_ms    = 300   # one card: how long the sole card beacons on op between dwells
search_after_ms = 5000  # on link loss, keep every card on op this long before sweeping
pick_margin     = 20    # auto: the pick must beat the channel the link is on by this many busy units
one_card_ms     = 5000  # one card, auto: measure silently this long before the first DISC
max_ms          = 30000 # auto: the pick is frozen at the latest this long after GS start
busy_dbm        = -83   # both modes: energy level that counts the air as busy (an NHM bucket edge)
blocked_pct     = 50    # both modes: % of busy foreign airtime that makes a half/window "blocked"
```

Drone, `bundle/mabur.default.toml`:

```toml
[radio]
channels = [40, 64, 112, 144]   # parks on the remembered member (else the first); follows the GS to any member
width    = 40
```

### Which knob drives which piece

| piece | runs when | knobs |
|---|---|---|
| **search** — find the drone over the set (`ChannelScout`, search job) | link down, both modes | `radio.scan.search_ms`, `op_window_ms`, `search_after_ms` |
| **measure** — rank the set, pick, freeze (`ChannelScout` measure job, `BootPick`) | pick open, `channel = "auto"` only | `radio.scan.dwell_ms`, `settle_ms`, `min_rounds`, `pick_margin`, `one_card_ms`, `max_ms` |
| **busy air** — what every measurer calls blocked | always | `radio.scan.busy_dbm`, `blocked_pct` (boot ranker, in-flight ranker, verdict alike) |
| **relocate** — the link forms where the drone is, one order moves it to `want` (pin or pick) | each link-up with `op ≠ want`, both modes | `[hop] confirm_ms`, `confirm_extend_ms`, `verify_ms`, `max_hops_per_min`, `one_card_repeats` (shared with the reactive hop) |
| **verdict** — is `op` bad right now | always (OSD / sideport `hop.verdict`) | `[hop] window_ms`, `persist`, `[hop.verdict] *` |
| **reactive hop** — in-flight scout, freshness burst, order/verify/withdraw | `channel = "auto"` only, after the freeze | everything else in `[hop]` |
| **one-card mode** | exactly one `[[radio.cards]]` entry | no in-flight scout; `one_card_ms`, `op_window_ms`, `one_card_repeats` apply |

There is no other mode switch. `[hop] enable` and `scout_when_disabled`
were deleted 2026-10-04: they made "pin, then roam" the default — a pinned
40 that read dirty hopped to 64 and `want` followed, so `scan.pick` said 40
while the link lived on 64 — and the only combination they added beyond the
two modes above was that one.

Removed, failing boot as every removed key does: GS `radio.channel` as a
number meaning home, `radio.scan.enable`, `candidates`, `home_window_ms`,
`split_after_ms`, `home_margin`; GS `hop.enable`, `hop.scout_when_disabled`,
`hop.verdict.busy_dbm`, `hop.verdict.blocked_pct` (2026-10-04 — the last
two live under `radio.scan`). Drone `radio.channel`, `radio.follow_gs`.
Drone `link.move_confirm_ms` and `link.rendezvous_ms` stay (the latter now
only drives the FAILSAFE → RENDEZVOUS state change, never a retune):

```toml
[link]
failsafe_ms     = 3000     # no word from the ground station this long = drop to the most robust link setting
rc_drain_ms     = 5        # how often commands from the ground station are applied
rendezvous_ms   = 30000    # still silent this long after failsafe = back to RENDEZVOUS (the drone stays on its channel)
move_confirm_ms = 2000     # after a channel move, hear the ground station within this or return to the channel we came from
```

Validation (`gs/src/config.cpp`, `drone/src/config.cpp`, shared code in
`common/include/mabur/channel_set.h`):

| key | range |
|---|---|
| `radio.channels` | 1–8 members, unique, each in `[1,177]`; at `width = 40` every member must be a standard HT40 pair primary and all members must share one `ht40_offset` (`docs/bw40.md` "Channels") |
| GS `radio.channel` | the string `"auto"`, or an integer that is a member of `radio.channels` — anything else fails |
| `radio.scan.dwell_ms` | 50–10000 |
| `radio.scan.settle_ms` | 0–1000 |
| `radio.scan.min_rounds` | 1–100 |
| `radio.scan.search_ms` | 40–2000 |
| `radio.scan.op_window_ms` | 40–10000 |
| `radio.scan.search_after_ms` | 0–600000 |
| `radio.scan.pick_margin` | 0–100000 |
| `radio.scan.one_card_ms` | 0–60000 |
| `radio.scan.max_ms` | 1000–600000 |
| `radio.scan.busy_dbm` | −104 – −70, on an `nf::kNhmAbsThDbm` bucket edge (`-104 -101 -98 -95 -92 -89 -86 -83 -80 -75 -70`) |
| `radio.scan.blocked_pct` | 1.0–100.0 |

### State files

Both daemons remember the member the link last lived on
(`common/include/mabur/channel_file.h`):

- Drone: `/etc/mabur.channel` (the writable overlay). Written by
  `RcAgent::remember_channel()` on every accepted RCF while a move is
  still pending — a DISC move or a hop move alike, confirmed the instant
  the GS is heard from on the new channel; a handful of writes per
  session, flash wear is a non-issue.
- GS: `/etc/maburgs.channel`. Written on every change of `ChannelPlan::op()`.

Format: the channel number as decimal text and a newline. Written via a
temp file in the same directory and `rename()`, so a power cut mid-write
leaves the old value, never a torn one. Read once at start; a missing,
unreadable or non-member value silently falls back to the first member —
nothing to repair, nothing to configure (the paths are compiled-in
constants). Deleting a state file makes that end forget its remembered
channel; on the GS that also forces the next boot to search from scratch
rather than re-finding a drone sitting on a channel the GS already
"knows."

## Drone behaviour (`RcAgent`, `drone/src/`)

- **Boot channel.** `channel_` = the remembered member (if the state file
  names one that is still in `radio.channels`), else `radio.channels[0]`.
  InitWrite tunes there at `radio.width`. No scan, no search; the drone
  listens and, as always, sends `T_TELEM` at 1 Hz in every state — that is
  its "shout".
- **Follows members only.** A DISC proposing a member the drone is not on:
  ack agreement from the current channel at DISC time; the retune itself
  happens once that agreed pair is promoted by the first verifying RCF
  (`act_.retune(ch, "disc")`), and the move is marked unconfirmed. (Since
  2026-10-04 the GS never sends such a DISC: every copy proposes the
  channel it is sent on, and the GS moves a linked drone only with hop
  orders — "Finding the drone" below. The path stays for robustness.) A DISC
  proposing a **non-member**: the drone acks its own current channel
  instead (`maburgs` logs `ack_override` on `ChannelPlan::on_ack`). An RCF
  `hop_ch` that is not a member is ignored for the retune, but the
  `(hop_epoch, hop_ch)` pair is still recorded as seen, so a repeated
  non-member order is not re-evaluated on every RCF.
- **Unconfirmed move goes back, never home.** After `move_confirm_ms` with
  nothing heard from the GS on the new channel: retune to
  `move_from_ch_` — the channel the drone came from, DISC move or hop
  alike — and enter RENDEZVOUS there. "There is no home to fall through
  to" (`drone/src/rc_agent.cpp`). `go_home_()` is deleted.
- **Long loss: stay put.** FAILSAFE entry and the `rendezvous_ms` timeout
  change state only (LINKED → FAILSAFE → RENDEZVOUS); neither retunes.
  The drone is always on exactly one member, which is what makes the GS
  sweep below complete — a search burst will eventually land on whatever
  channel the drone is parked on.
- **Retune mechanics unchanged**: TX-gate exclusive, 5 ms drain,
  `FastRetune`, TX power re-applied, calibration deferral (latched and
  replayed on the sweep's falling edge), stderr
  `maburd: retune A -> B (reason)`. Reasons: `disc`, `hop`,
  `move_unconfirmed`. `rendezvous` is gone — there is no retune on that
  path any more.
- **Wire: no change.** `Disc.op_channel`/`DiscAck.agreed_channel` and
  `Rcf.hop_ch`/`hop_epoch` carry members exactly as before. No
  `RC_VERSION` bump.

Invariant: the drone is always on a member of its set, and only moves on
a GS proposal, a GS order, or an unconfirmed move back to where it came
from.

## GS: search and measure (`ChannelScout`, `gs/src/channel_scout.{h,cpp}`)

**Where the code lives (2026-10-04).** Everything this page describes on
the GS side is wired inside `gs/src/channel_core.{h,cpp}` (`ChannelCore`):
`main.cpp` builds one with the card roster and calls it at six seams
(lifecycle, the rc sink, the drain loop, `tick()`, the send path, the
sideport). The decision units (`ChannelPlan`, `BootPick`, `ChannelScout`,
`HopVerdict`, `HopRanker`, `HopController`, `InflightScout`) are unchanged.
Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-web-gs-channel-core-design.md`
(gitignored; this page and `docs/inflight-channel-hop.md` are the durable
record). The browser GS (`docs/web-gs.md`) will drive the same unit (plan 2, not yet built).

`ChannelScout` is the long-lived scheduler that owns the spare USB card
(two-card) or the sole card between op windows (one card) whenever it has
work. It replaces the old boot-only scan: it no longer stops at the first
ack. `has_work = search || (measure && !frozen)` — it searches while the
link is down and/or measures while the pick is still open (auto mode
only); with no work it parks the card on `op` at `radio.width` and sits
idle.

**Dwell schedule.** Round-robin over the 20 MHz **half set**
(`pair_pick.h`'s `scan_half_set` over the set — no home — each pair's low
half then high half, config order; at `width = 20` the members
themselves). Per half:

| phase | when | what |
|---|---|---|
| retune + settle | always | `FastRetune(half, 20)`, `settle_ms` |
| **search burst** | link down AND half is a pair primary (or width 20) | send DISC proposing `op` every beacon period for `search_ms`; listen for the ack |
| gap | after a burst | one beacon period, so the card's own TX is out of its receiver |
| discard read | measuring | as today |
| **observe** | pick open (auto) | silent `dwell_ms`, read FA/CCA/own/foreign/NHM |

Pinned mode: no observe, ever (`measure = false`) — a sweep of four
primaries ≈ 0.6 s. Auto, link down: burst + observe (≈ 3.2 s per round
over eight halves at the shipped defaults). Auto, linked, pick open:
observe only.

**Op's own pair is never measured while linked** (final review I1,
2026-10-04). With the search off (linked, or inside `search_after_ms`
after a loss) and the pick open, the scout skips both halves of `op`'s
pair (`op` alone at `width = 20`): no retune, no observe. They carry the
drone's own video — at width 40 undecodable to a 20 MHz observe and so
counted busy, and in NHM's airtime either way — and scoring them would
make the boot hop leave a clean `op` almost every time. A skipped half is
completed in the scheduler (stamped one dwell ahead) so the round-robin
and `rounds()` keep moving. `op` keeps only its pre-link visits:
`ChannelScout::mature()` waits for every member **except** `op` (and for
`op` too while searching, when it is visited like any other), and
`op_ranked()` says whether `op`'s pre-link visits reached the effective
`min_rounds`. When they did not, the pick freezes in place (`"op
unmeasured"`, below).

**The leak.** Unlinked, the TX card holds its DISC during every observe
(`quiet()`, unchanged from the 2026-09-13 fix — see History below).
Linked, RCFs must flow, so the TX card is never held; its TX leaks into the
adjacent scout as undecodable energy. The ranker subtracts
`k × tx_frames_during_observe` from the dwell's busy score
(`ChannelRanker::busy()`: `max(cca − own − leak, 0) + fa + foreign`), where
`tx_frames_during_observe` is the TX card's frame-counter delta over the
observe span (`ChannelScout::set_tx_frames()`, fed `ctrl_sent_total`,
incremented once per successful `send_control()` across every card) and
`k` (`leak_per_frame`) is a **compiled constant**, `1.0`
(`gs/src/main.cpp`, "bench row 7 pins this"), not a config key. The leak is
uniform across candidates, so it biases only the stay-or-move comparison,
and `pick_margin` absorbs the residual. Bench row 7 (below) is the
standing validation of that constant: it has not run yet, so `k` is
provisional.

**One card.** Cycle: op window of `op_window_ms` on `op` (DISC every
beacon period, listen; leave only after one quiet beacon period), then one
dwell on the next half. Auto mode adds a **silent prelude**: for the first
`one_card_ms` after start the card only observes (no DISC anywhere); once
the deadline passes, the core commits the prelude's ranking (if not
already linked and it differs from `op`) and calls
`ChannelScout::ack_prelude(op)`, which hands the scout the committed
channel and releases the first op window — the scout holds (no tune, no
beaconing, `working()` stays true) until that ack arrives, so no window
ever runs against the stale pre-commit `op`. Linked, the sole card carries
the link and cannot measure: the pick freezes at link-up (`"one-card
linked"`), and a link found off `op`/`want` is then relocated by the
one-card hop path.

**Width.** The scout card tunes 20 MHz for its dwells and rejoins the link
at `radio.width` on `op` when it has no work (`ChannelScout::run()` parks
there; the core loop's one-shot width resync covers the scout-card-died
and freeze-before-scout-started edge cases, same as the 40 MHz page
describes).

**Send gating** (`gs/src/main.cpp`): the scout owns a card
(`scout_owns()`: `working() || search requested || (!pinned &&
pick_open())`) whenever the core must not also touch it — mechanical
retune, TX selection, verdict input, width resync, the in-flight scout and
freshness burst, the relocation gate all key on it. The send gate and DISC
routing use the narrower `working()`/`beaconing()`: one-card mode drops
the sole card's non-DISC frames while it is off `op`; two-card mode holds
the TX card's DISC while `quiet()`. The scout's own DISC bursts are sent
by the scout card from the scout thread's own schedule, not the core
loop's beacon.

**Relays** keep beaconing DISC on `op` whenever `ready()`, never as the
only path (`scan_disc_targets()` in `gs/src/scout_pick.h` has no home
branch any more, but keeps the relay rule: a CPE still booting, unplugged
or owned by another client must not be the only way a DISC leaves the
GS).

**Who scouts, who beacons** is otherwise unchanged from before this
feature (`gs/src/scout_pick.h`): the boot/in-flight scout is the last
scout-capable card — the spare USB card on a two-USB GS, the only card on
a one-USB GS. A CPE510 relay (`docs/cpe510-relay.md`) has no FA/CCA/NHM
reads and never scouts. No `[[radio.cards]]` block pins nothing: auto-scan
uses every supported USB card found, which is two-card mode; an explicit
`[[radio.cards]]` list (one entry) is how you fly one card.

## Finding the drone: link where found, then relocate

**A DISC is discovery only; every move of a linked link is a hop order**
(final review C1, 2026-10-04 — user decision). Since link pairing the drone
retunes only after the first RCF that verifies under the pending pair
(`docs/link-pairing.md` "Rendezvous, as built"), and before this fix a
drone found on a member X ≠ `op` never linked: its ack opened the GS
session, but RCFs left on the TX card on `op` and the drone on X never
heard one. Now:

- **The DISC proposes the channel it is sent on.** One DISC is built per
  tick proposing `op`; every copy fanned to a card on another member is
  re-proposed and re-tagged for that card's channel
  (`disc_for_channel()`, `gs/src/vrx_controller.h`). A search burst's DISC
  on X therefore proposes X: the drone agrees to stay, and never retunes
  itself on promotion.
- **The link forms where the drone is.** When the ack that **opened** the
  session (BEACONING → SESSION inside that `on_rc_frame` call; our nonce,
  not key-mismatch flagged — a stranger's drone cannot drag the cards) was
  heard on a member X ≠ `op` (that body's `rx_channel`),
  `ChannelPlan::link_found()` moves `op` to X for **every** card (the TX
  card too, via the mechanical retune), the scout parks there, and the
  proposal follows. `M all <op> <X> link_found`; stderr `maburgs channel:
  drone found on X (op Y): the link forms there`.
- **Then it is relocated.** `ChannelPlan::want()` is where the link
  *should* live: the pin in pinned mode, else the start channel, later the
  committed pick. While linked with `op ≠ want` (`relocate_due()`), the
  boot-pick state machine (`gs/src/boot_pick.h`) hands out one **relocate**
  order per link-up — once the scout owns no card, no hop is in flight and
  the controller is `Idle`/`Hold` — through the ordinary hop machinery
  (two cards: the non-TX card leads; one card: the one-card path).
  `HopTick::relocate`: H kind `relocate`; the channel left is not backed
  off as fled; exempt from `cooldown_ms`, counted against
  `max_hops_per_min`; and it is the one hop a pinned GS ever places.
  **Onto the pin the confirm lands it** (`HopTick::no_verify`, 2026-10-04):
  there is no verify window, because its question — is the channel we
  landed on better than the one we left — has no answer when the target is
  the only place the link may live. `verify_pass` follows `lead_confirm` on
  the next tick; the pin is never backed off and a dirty pin never reads as
  a failed hop (bench row 9 saw `verify_fail` +332 ms under the 36-48
  router before this). Relocations onto an auto pick keep their verify.
  `verify_pass` lands it. Anything else — withdraw, verify fail (no retry:
  the only target offered is `want`), a session lost before or after the
  confirm, the hop cap — accepts the channel the link is on
  (`set_want(op)`) until the next link-up. While a relocation is due or in
  flight no reactive order or freshness burst may take the controller.
- **Pinned mode:** a drone found off the pin links there and is relocated
  to the pin on that link-up; if that fails the GS stays where the link is
  until the next loss (then beacons on that `op`) — the sideport shows
  `link.channel ≠ scan.pick`. The reactive hop never runs pinned: an
  interfered pin is reported (`hop.verdict`, the OSD) and stays. The
  controller is never handed a reactive trigger in any arm of the core's
  dispatch (cleared once, before the arms; the relocation arm re-arms it).
- A confirmed hop of either kind moves `want` with `op`: a reactive hop's
  destination is where the link should live from then on, so a later
  link-up does not relocate back onto the channel it fled.

## The pick: maturity, commit, relocation, freeze

**Ranking.** `pair_proposal(all, current, set, min_rounds, pick_margin,
blocked_pct)` (`gs/src/pair_pick.h`): a pair is ranked once both halves
have `min_rounds` visits (the one-card deadline uses the *effective*
`min_rounds` — 1, once the prelude is done and fewer than `min_rounds`
full passes exist, else the configured value — so a one-card prelude pick
counts as measured). Score = the worse half's worst-visit busy; the
blocked tier (either half's NHM busy ≥ `radio.scan.blocked_pct`) ranks after every
unblocked pair. The channel the link currently sits on (`op`) plays the
role home used to play: a candidate must beat it by `pick_margin`, ties
stay on `op`. Config order breaks remaining ties. Returns `op` when
nothing else is ranked.

The whole pick is `BootPick` (`gs/src/boot_pick.{h,cpp}`, pure, every
exit covered by `tests/test_boot_pick.cpp`); `main.cpp` only feeds it a
`BootPickIn` per tick and applies its one `BootPickOut`.

**At maturity** (every member but `op` ranked — `op` too while searching —
`ChannelScout::mature()`):

- **Op unmeasured** (`!op_ranked()`, final review I1): a linked scout
  never visits `op`'s own pair, so a drone found at once leaves `op` with
  only its pre-link visits. A working link is not moved on a one-sided
  comparison: freeze in place (`"op unmeasured"`); the reactive hop covers
  a dirty `op` later.
- **No link** (GS powered first): `ChannelPlan::commit()` moves `op` and
  `want` (the TX card retunes; stderr `maburgs channel: commit <from> ->
  <to> (no link)`, `M all <from> <to> commit`, the state file is written).
  Freeze (`"commit"`). The drone, when it appears on its remembered
  member, is found there by a search burst, the link forms there, and it
  is relocated to the pick (above).
- **Linked, proposal ≠ op**: `set_want(pick)` and the scout is frozen
  (stops measuring, parks, frees the lead card); the relocation moves the
  link — this **is** the boot hop (`maburgs channel: boot pick wants
  <pick>, link on <op>: relocating`, `H relocate`). `restore_rung` = the
  verdict's `ref_rung` (the current rung — "keep the current rung"). The
  pick freezes when the controller is back in `Idle`/`Hold`: `"relocated"`
  on `verify_pass`, else `"relocate failed, staying"` (the link stays
  where it is, `want` follows it).
- **Linked, one card**: the scout owns the only card while the pick is
  open, so the pick freezes at link-up (`"one-card linked"`) and the
  relocation, if due, follows once the scout has parked — one card now
  relocates too, by the one-card hop path.
- **Proposal == op**: freeze in place (`"in place"`).

**Freeze** closes the pick for the GS process's lifetime: the scout stops
measuring and rejoins the link at full width. Logged
`maburgs channel: pick frozen on <pick> (<why>) after <rounds> rounds`
plus a `K` line (shape unchanged: `K <t> <picked|none> <rounds>
<ch>:<worst_busy>:<floor|nan>:<busy|-> ... pair=<lo>+<hi>|-`; `picked` is
`want` after the decision — every freeze-in-place exit has accepted `op`
first). From here only the reactive hop (`docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`)
and the per-link-up relocation move the link. The reasons, first match
wins: `"scout card died"`, `"one-card linked"`, `"relocated"` / `"relocate
failed, staying"`, `"max_ms"` (unmeasured: stay where the link is; a
relocation in flight is never yanked — it freezes when it resolves),
`"link lost before relocate"` (the link dropped between wanting the pick
and placing the order — the pick stands, the next link-up relocates
there), `"op unmeasured"`, `"commit"`, `"in place"`, `"calibration
running"`. Gone since 2026-10-04: `"boot hop: no eligible pair"` (the
relocation's only target is `want`) and `"hop disabled"` (the kill switch
it bypassed, `hop.enable`, was deleted the same day).

No eligibility/arm gate: the relocation is placed armed or not. It is a
measured, verified, withdrawn-on-failure move; mid-flight it meets an
armed drone only after a GS restart or a loss, and then it costs what a
reactive hop costs.

Timing at the defaults, two cards, both powered together (design figure,
not yet bench-confirmed — see Bench validation row 1): link on the
remembered member within ~1 s; three rounds of eight halves ≈ 10 s;
relocation lands ≈ 0.5 s later.

## In-flight hop after the freeze

Once the pick freezes, only the reactive hop
(`docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`) can move the link, and only off an
`interfered` verdict. That page's own candidate list is now
`radio.channels` (no home appended) and its exhaustion path holds rather
than falling back anywhere — see its §1, §3, §5 and §7 for the as-built
detail, updated for this feature.

## Observability

- **`scan.log`**: marker `scanlog 5` (bumped from `scanlog 4`). Header
  line: `scanlog 5 channels=<c1,c2,...> mode=<auto|pinned>
  dwell_ms=<n> min_rounds=<n> cards=<n>`. `C`/`D`/`K` record shapes are
  unchanged from `scanlog 4` (`docs/bw40.md`,
  `docs/nhm-airtime-spike-findings-2026-09-25.md`). `M` loses the
  `split_home`/`reunite` reasons — there is nothing to split from or
  reunite to any more — and keeps `commit`/`ack_override` plus the
  in-flight hop's `hop_lead`/`hop_follow`/`hop_withdraw`/`hop_one_card`.
  `M` also gains `link_found` (2026-10-04, marker unchanged: the link
  formed where the drone was found). `H` gains the `relocate` kind
  alongside the in-flight hop's `order`/`verify_fail`/`escape`
  (`gs/src/scan_log.h`) — named `boot_order` in the pre-merge 2026-10-03
  bench builds. A `scanlog 4` or earlier file never has `relocate` and
  still has `split_home`/
  `reunite` in its `M` lines — read it as what it was
  (`docs/data-provenance.md`).
- **Sideport**: `scan.state` ∈ `off | scouting | moving | frozen` (`off` —
  pinned, or no scout-capable card; `scouting` — the pick is open;
  `moving` — the pick's relocation (the boot hop) is in flight; `frozen` —
  the pick is closed). `scan.rounds` (the scout's round count). `scan.pick`
  is **latched** (final review I2, 2026-10-04): the channel the pick froze
  on (`ChannelPlan::want()` at the freeze, after any accept-in-place), or
  the pin from the start in pinned mode — never the live `op`, which a
  reactive hop or a found-elsewhere link moves; null while the pick is
  open. `link.home` is **deleted** — there is
  no home to report. `link.channel` is unchanged: the live channel of the
  TX card.
- **stderr**: `maburd: channel set [<c1,c2,...>], parking on <n>[
  (remembered)]` (drone boot); `maburgs channel: set [<c1,c2,...>] mode
  <auto|pinned> start <n>[ (remembered)]` (GS boot); `maburgs channel:
  commit <from> -> <to> (no link)`; `maburgs channel: drone found on <x>
  (op <n>): the link forms there`; `maburgs channel: boot pick wants <pick>,
  link on <op>: relocating`; `maburgs channel: relocate <from> -> <to>
  placed|refused (hop cap)`; `maburgs channel: relocation to <want> did not
  land; staying on <op>`;
  `maburgs channel: pick frozen on <pick> (<why>) after <n> rounds`;
  `maburgs channel: one-card prelude ranking picks <n> (op <n>)[, linked:
  not committed]`; `maburgs channel: drone acked <n>, not in our set;
  ignored`; `maburgs channel: <reason> card <n> <from> -> <to>` (every `M`
  line, echoed to stderr); `maburgs channel: could not write
  /etc/maburgs.channel`; `maburd: retune <a> -> <b> (<reason>)`.
- **`tools/maburtop.py`**: drops the `h{home}` field from the compact
  channel line; shows `scan.state` (including `moving`) and `scan.rounds`
  next to the channel.
- **`tools/flightreport.py`**: reads `scanlog 5`; treats `relocate` (and
  the bench builds' `boot_order`) as a HOP-section order kind alongside
  `order`/`verify_fail`/`escape`; still
  parses `split_home` out of an older-marker file, since a recording made
  before this date still carries it (`docs/data-provenance.md`).

## Deploy

Binary then config on **each** device (old binaries reject the new keys;
new binaries reject `radio.channel`/`follow_gs`). Drone first or GS first
does not matter — there is no `RC_VERSION` bump, so a half-deployed pair
still links on whichever member both ends happen to be on (the old
binary's `radio.channel` home and the new binary's remembered/first member
may well differ, in which case the pair simply does not link until the
deploy finishes — the usual two-devices-never-atomic story, not a new
risk).

Deleting a state file (`/etc/mabur.channel` or `/etc/maburgs.channel`)
makes that end forget its remembered channel on the next boot and fall
back to `radio.channels[0]` (drone) or search from `channels[0]`/the pin
(GS). Useful when a device was last parked somewhere you no longer want it
defaulting to.

sequence and verification lines.

None of these has been run yet — the "result" column is the one place in
this repo's docs a `pending` value is allowed, because it records that the

### Bench 2026-10-04 — findings

**The event-score ranker is fooled by a strong co-located jammer (row 6).** On the jammed pair the jam's frames decode and count once each as `foreign`; centimetres away, the same frames leak into every other half as several FA/CCA events each, so every clean half read 444-1286 while the jammed pair read 130-165 and won. NHM busy was the honest signal: 32.8 % on both jammed halves (exactly the jam's computed airtime, 250 × 1.33 ms) against 0-12 % elsewhere, but below `blocked_pct = 50`. The no-jam baseline taken immediately after read 36:4 60:6 64:4 140:9 144:14. This is the ranker's scoring, not the rendezvous; candidates for a follow-up: an airtime-weighted foreign term, a lower `blocked_pct`, or NHM busy as a primary score term. A jammer at field distance leaks far less off-channel, so the bench overstates the effect.

**Linked-phase measurement is inflated on the bench (row 7).** With the drone a few centimetres from the GS, its own video TX reads as energy on every half the scout dwells on, so the linked K line sits 15-80 events above the unlinked one and `leak_per_frame` cannot be fitted here. Because op's own halves are skipped while linked and the margin is applied against op, this biases the pick among candidates only where the inflation is uneven (it was: 140/144 rose more than 60/64).

**Two reactive hops fired within seconds of link-up (rows 1 and 4)**, both on genuine evidence (the 36-48 router; a transient ~120 frames/s burst with 7-8 % loss on 64). They are the existing reactive layer at its shipped persistence (2 of 3 windows) and are listed here only because a pilot will see them as "the channel changed right after power-up".

### Bench 2026-10-04 — channel core extraction

This is a regression check that branch `channel-core` (c338e15, the channel/hop wiring moved out of `run_radio()` into `gs/src/channel_core.{h,cpp}`) changed nothing on hardware. The GS ran the new `maburgs` (rollback `maburgs.pre-chancore`) and the drone was unchanged. `debug_log.enable` was switched on temporarily to get `scan.log` (sessions `/media/dvr/log/0002`-`0003`), then switched back off. Each run was compared against the earlier 2026-10-04 sessions `0000`/`0001` on the same GS. The check covered the stderr strings, the `scanlog 5 channels=40,64,112,144 mode=auto dwell_ms=250 min_rounds=3 cards=N` header, the column counts of each record kind (C 13, D 19, H 7, M 6, V 27 two-card / 17 one-card, K 11 while linked / 13 unlinked) and the order of K/M/H events. **No difference in shape or sequence under matched conditions. Only timings differ.**

| check | result |
|---|---|
| ausniff gate | PASS — 60 s linked on 64: 1816 AUs, 0 frame_id gaps, 0 incomplete, 30.3 fps |
| Row 1 (cold start both, two cards, auto) | PASS — drone already beaconing on 64 when maburgs (re)started, as in session 0000 (the GS boots slower than the drone). `set [40,64,112,144] mode auto start 64 (remembered)`, link immediately, `K` after 3 rounds 8.6 s after the C lines (0000: 8.6 s), `pick frozen on 64 (op unmeasured) after 3 rounds`. The same shape repeated on a later restart on 144. No reactive hop fired (the 36-48 router stayed quiet). ausniff 30 s: 916 AUs, 0 gaps. The literal order (drone off → GS restart → drone on) froze before the drone booted (`pick frozen on 64 (commit) after 3 rounds`, no M line because pick == op), then linked on 64. That is the row-2 path, as expected when the drone needs 30-40 s to boot |
| Row 3 (battery swap) | PASS — drone `parking on 64 (remembered)`, linked at its first stats line. The GS session rotated `0002 -> 0003` (tlm_seq 201 -> 0) and logged zero `maburgs channel:`/`maburgs hop:` lines. It did log one `REFUSING video: peer session did not advertise CAP_FRAME_WIRE (chip_caps=0x0007)` during the gap. That line is pre-existing and unchanged code (`peer_acked && !fw`), and video resumed on the same second |
| Row 5 (one card auto, `[[radio.cards]]` pinned, GS state file 40, drone on 64) | PASS, same lines as the 2026-10-04 row: `one-card prelude ranking picks 144 (op 40)`, `commit card -1 40 -> 144`, `drone found on 64 (op 144): the link forms there`, `link_found`, `pick frozen on 144 (one-card linked) after 2 rounds`, `relocate 64 -> 144 placed`, `one_card_retune` +216 ms (was +253), `hop_one_card`, `lead_confirm` +235 ms (was +272), `hop_follow`, `verify_pass` +1000 ms. The scan.log order M commit, M link_found, K, H relocate, H one_card_retune, M hop_one_card, H lead_confirm, M hop_follow, H verify_pass is identical to session 0001. ausniff 30 s: 916 AUs, 0 gaps |
| Reactive hop (benchjam 250 fps / 1000 B / 6M, co-located) | PASS — at the lowest TX-power step on op 64: `H order` → `M hop_lead 64 144` → `lead_confirm` +122 ms → `M hop_follow` → `verify_pass` +1009 ms. ausniff 60 s: 1814 AUs, 1 frame_id gap, 0 incomplete. That gap is 181 ms before the order (jam loss inside the detection window), not at the hop. The first run, at the calibrated default power on op 144, chained 144 → 64 → 40 → 112 through `verify_fail` (the jam leaks onto every channel at bench distance, see the findings above) and then held on 112 (`hold_exhausted`/`hold_end` ×5) until the jam ended. After that it went `order` → 64 → `verify_pass`. ausniff 75 s: 5 gaps, all during the verify_fail chain or the jammed hold, none at a confirmed hop |

## Out of scope

The web GS (`web/`) runs this feature through the same `ChannelCore` in GS mode on its one card (`docs/web-gs.md` "Channel set"); the relay-only page searches without measuring (§3.7 of the 2026-10-04 spec). A runtime auto/pin
switch. Width negotiation over DISC (both ends keep `radio.width = 40`).
Relay channel capability — the operator rule that every member must be
CPE-tunable stays a documented rule, `docs/cpe510-relay.md` (a relay GS
drops 144 from its own set by hand; the scan has no way to ask the relay).
2.4 GHz, per-card channels.

## History

The material below is retained from the 2026-09-13 design
(`docs/channel-scan-findings-2026-09-13.md`) because it explains why every
scout dwell is silent and why the ranker subtracts a leak term — both
still true, under the new no-home scheduler, exactly as they were under
the old boot-only one.

### The `cca − own` assumption (2026-09-13)

The ranker's busy score (`gs/src/channel_ranker.{h,cpp}`) was:

```
busy = (cca_ofdm − canonical_frames) + fa_ofdm + foreign_frames
```

`cca_ofdm` counts every OFDM CCA event the chip saw, including the ones
caused by our own beacon and RCF traffic — subtracting `own` (canonical-SA
frames decoded) is meant to leave foreign busy only, on the assumption
that one decoded own-frame costs exactly one CCA event. If a decoded frame
actually costs more than one CCA event (aggregation, retries at the PHY),
the subtraction under-corrects and channels get scored busier than they
are. The formula has since grown a third term, `leak` (above) — the same
assumption, extended to cover TX that is never decoded as "own" at all
because the scout card isn't the one receiving it.

### Bench validation 2026-09-13

The committed record behind `leak_per_frame = 1.0` (the `cca − own`
rows: one decoded single-MPDU frame is one CCA event) and behind the
silent dwell. It describes the superseded home/candidates design — home,
`split_home`/`reunite`, `A` records and `home_window_ms` are all gone —
and is kept verbatim as what was measured then.

Bench, drone on the desk, GS session `/media/dvr/log/0069` (`scan.log`
carries every K/M line below). Deployed binary-before-config on both ends;
rollbacks `maburgs.pre-chansel` / `maburd.pre-chansel` + `*.toml.pre-chansel`
(the drone's `maburd.pre-cal` was pruned to make room).

| check | result |
|---|---|
| C record, both GS cards | `RTL8822E jaguar3 2x2 1f 5080-6165 1 1 1 1 1` — all four sensors valid incl. the absolute floor; the drone (no floor opt-in) reports `floor=0` |
| scout cadence, two cards | 11 visits per channel in 18 s (round ≈ 1.1 s at the defaults) |

| link loss (drone stopped), one card | `M 0 161 153 split_home` at loss + 5 s |
| drone restart, one card | drone boots on 153, caught in a home window: GS `M 0 153 161 reunite`, drone `retune 153 -> 161 (disc)`, 60.4 fps |
| `cca − own` (beacons) | on home the scouting card saw own=12 beacons and cca=12: one decoded single-MPDU frame is one CCA event |
| `cca − own` (video, A records) | cca 226-948 against own ≈ 2200 frames/s: CCA counts PPDUs, so under A-MPDU `cca − own` clamps to 0 and the A record's busy is `fa + foreign` |
| A records at 1 Hz | no change in ausniff cadence (60.3 fps with them on) |
| restored flight config (home 136, two cards) | `K 136 10 136:1 149:50 153:53 161:58`, commit home, 60.5 fps |

Not done: the 2 s RF fade (needs an antenna pull), the two-card split/reunite
(needs a home-losing pick, see the bias below), the `tx_gate` exclusive
latency measurement, and `lat.log` e2e with A records on vs off.

### Bench findings 2026-09-13: own beacons dominated every reading (fixed the same day)

With two cards the beaconing card's DISC TX (every 20 ms, a few cm from
the scout) leaked into the scout on EVERY channel: on home the leak
decoded as our own frames and `cca − own` subtracted it (home read ~2), on
a candidate it was undecodable energy and counted as busy (~25-40 per
250 ms with zero frames). The same channel read 5 as home and 152 as a
candidate minutes apart. With one card the card's own TX leaked into its
receiver during the home window (home read ~25 against candidates at
0-12). Silencing the beacon only for the home dwell, and parking the home
card 40 MHz away, changed nothing — the leak is on the candidate side — so
parking was dropped again.

Fix: every dwell is silent. Two cards: the TX card holds its DISC while
the scout is observing (`quiet()`). One card: the home/op cycle is a beacon
phase, a quiet gap, then a silent observe with its own discard read. After
the fix (drone off, home 153, candidates 136/149/161): two cards, scout =
card 1: 136 0.7 / 149 6.6 / 153 2.9 / 161 1.6 mean busy (worst 5-10),
floors −92…−96 — home was no longer privileged. One card, card 0: 0.0 /
5.8 / 4.1 / 1.1; card 1: 0.4 / 8.6 / 5.0 / 3.8. Clean channels sat within
~10 units of each other, so with no improvement margin the pick among
clean channels is effectively arbitrary — this is exactly why
`pick_margin` exists and why the shipped default channel set
(`docs/bw40.md` "Channels") is curated to channels worth flying rather
than left to an automatic search of the whole band.

### Two small findings from the same bench (2026-09-13)

**`[[radio.cards]]` needs decimal VIDs.** The TOML subset rejects `0x0bda`
(`'0x0bda' is not a valid value`) and maburgs crash-loops on the respawn;
the bundle's commented example now says `3034`.

**The GS's own Wi-Fi AP drops stations around a restart.** The `aicwf_sdio`
AP logged STA churn at the moment of a maburgs restart (its USB resets), and
a laptop on that AP saw "no route to host" for ~20 s. Not a reboot: uptime
and the session directory were continuous.
