# Data provenance — date every recording

Several link-wide behaviours and metric scales changed on known dates.
Recordings that span one of these are not the same experiment and must
not be pooled. Nothing in the sideport reports most of them, so the only
reliable method is to date the recording against this page.

Quick index: carrier sense off 2026-08-05 · carrier sense ON again + RC_VERSION 10 + `link.pre_fec_loss` guard 32 → 192 2026-09-23 · TX power constant 2026-08-12 ·

`.sweeps`, `hop.sweep_timeouts` — 2026-10-05 (`docs/cpe510-relay.md`) ·
2026-10-10: `au.log` marker `# aulog 5` (+4 salvage columns); sideport
`link.video.slice_*` keys added; FrameHdr byte 3 is `slice_rows` (was
codec id 0x01 — recordings before this date read as slice_rows 1 in no
tool, the byte was never logged) (`docs/slices.md`) · 2026-10-10:
maburplay submits slice-salvaged AUs, so LAT / e2e latency tails during
loss include frames that were skipped before (section below).

**`link.pre_fec_loss` scale break 2026-09-23, twice.** The ArrivalTracker
guard behind `link.pre_fec_loss` (and the OSD LOSS row, `ctl.pre_fec_loss`,
`streams[*].arr_late`) moved from a compile-time 32 to the new
`link.arrival_guard_syms` key, default 192; and the link-level key now
pools base + enh where it was base-only before (`ctl.pre_fec_loss` is
still base-only). Recordings before this date
carry ~1 % of "loss" that was late arrival from the drone's USB TX pool
reordering, not air loss (`docs/observability.md` "pre-FEC loss is late,
not lost"); after it the same channel reads ~0.02 %. Compare
`streams[*].recovered` per second across the break, never
`pre_fec_loss`.

**Carrier sense is back ON on both daemons since 2026-09-23** (`RC_VERSION`
10, `docs/cca-on-findings-2026-09-23.md`): both bring-up lines read
`requested ON`, and `Telem`/the sideport carry the drone's own RX-side
channel view (`drone.radio.rx`, per telemetry period) so a recording
says what the drone deferred to. Recordings between the two dates below
are the blind-injection era; the GS-send self-collision they carry
(~1.5 lost drone PPDUs/s on both cards, visible as `streams[*].recovered`
and fec.log episodes) does not exist after it.

**Carrier sense was OFF on both daemons from 2026-08-05 to 2026-09-23.** `maburd` and
`maburgs` both set `dev_cfg.tuning.disable_cca = true` at bring-up, so the
radios inject without the MAC CCA/EDCCA gate — no deferral to co-channel
802.11, and no politeness toward it either. Rationale is in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-cca-disable-design.md` (gitignored,
hence this note) — that spec is a protocol with an expectations table, not
results: the 41-45% injection-deferral figure it cites is devourer's own
measurement, taken with its `txdemo` injector on an 8822EU (same chip
family), not with maburd, and the mabur-side bench A/B has not run yet.
Expected practical consequence for anyone reading old data: in a congested
environment a pre-2026-08-05 recording and a post- one would not be the
same experiment, since the drone's injection rate under interference is
expected to change. On a clean channel the gate never trips and the two
stay comparable. Bench harnesses (`linkbench`, `txagcbench`) are
deliberately left building a plain `DeviceConfig` — carrier sense stays ON
there, so don't assume they share the daemons' MAC config. Nothing in the
sideport reports the CCA state — date the recording against this line. To
confirm it on a running device, grep the daemon log for `carrier sense`:
both daemons print a one-line bring-up record (`maburd radio:` / `maburgs
radio card N:`, once per card bring-up — a recovered front-end reprints
it, so more than one line per card on a multi-card GS is expected).
devourer's own carrier-sense line is info-level and so is compiled out of
the cross-builds' `DEVOURER_LOG_MAX_LEVEL=WARN` — its absence means
nothing. Both lines record the state mabur *requested*, not a register
readback.

**TX power is constant since 2026-08-12.** There is no runtime power
control anywhere in mabur: no GS-commanded offset, no thermal derate, no
per-profile offset. `maburd` programs the wall-equalized per-rate diff
table and zeroes the global offset once at bring-up — both steps live
inside the `radio.power_mode: "offset"` branch — and never calls a power
API again: for the life of the process each rate `r` sits at effective
TXAGC index `anchor(channel) + rate_walls_rel[r] − round(wall_margin_db *
4)`. Note the
`* 4`: the chip's index step is 0.25 dB, so `wall_margin_db` is a dB
figure converted to index steps, and a 1 dB margin is 4 steps
(`make_power_plan()` in `drone/src/power_plan.h`). The config keys
`radio.thermal_max_delta`,
`radio.min_offset_qdb`, `radio.power_offset_qdb` and
`link.static_offset_qdb` were REMOVED and now FAIL BOOT, as does
`radio.power_mode: "override"` (it had become identical to `"none"`).
Also REMOVED: `radio.rate_walls_idx`, `radio.legacy_wall_idx`,
`radio.base_ref_idx` (2026-09-13, replaced by `rate_walls_rel`/
`legacy_wall_rel`).
Sideport keys `link.op.offset_qdb`, `drone.applied.offset_qdb` and
`drone.applied.derate_qdb` are gone; `thermal_delta` REMAINS and is the
only surviving signal that a PA is running hot — nothing acts on it, so
acting on it is a human decision (most likely an airframe cooling fix,
not a power one). `bench/txagcbench` still drives `SetTxPowerOffsetQdb`
directly and is still how the walls are measured; it was deliberately
left alone. Date any recording against this line, the same way the
2026-08-04 SNR scale break is dated.

**Walls are measured by `maburcal`, not `txagcbench`, since 2026-09-10.**
`bench/txagcbench/` was deleted that day and the sentence above is
historical from then on — it describes how the walls in a recording made
before it were produced. The kit that replaced it (`docs/calibration.md`)
sweeps from inside the running daemons rather than from a bench harness:
the drone's own `CalSweep` parks each TXAGC index through the same
`SetTxPowerIndexOverride` path production uses, and the GS tallies
delivery. Two consequences for comparing runs. A wall measured before
this date came from a standalone TX/RX pair with no daemon MAC config
(carrier sense ON, see the 2026-08-05 line above); one measured after
comes from the flying pair with the GS radio-silent for the whole sweep.
And a post-2026-09-10 run leaves its own raw record — `cal.log` in the
debug-log session directory: `callog 1`/`2` (absolute walls, anchor on
the R line) through 2026-09-13, `callog 3` (relative walls, `-128` =
undetermined) after; `maburcal report` reads all three — where a
txagcbench run left a CSV the deleted Python analyzer read.

**DVR filenames carry no date since 2026-08-26.** `maburplay` writes
`record-NNNN.mp4` (index one past the highest already on the card), where it
used to write `record_%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.mp4` with a `-1`/`-2` suffix for
collisions inside the same second. The date came from the GS RTC, which is
wrong at boot, so it never dated anything reliably — but it did sort, and
files written before this date still sort chronologically among themselves
while the new ones sort by index. A card holds both: the two families never
collide (the scan ignores `record_`-prefixed names) and old files keep their
names, so pair an old recording with its jsonl/ctl neighbours by mtime, not
by the stem. Same reasoning as `ctl-NNNN` and `flight-NNNN`, which were
index-first all along — both names retired by the 2026-09-06 consolidation,
whose own `NNNN` session-directory index is index-first for the same
reason.

Schema/design references (local, gitignored):
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-gs-stats-sideport-design.md` and
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-26-drone-telemetry-design.md`. The schema
is NOT additive-only — per the compatibility policy in CLAUDE.md, keys get
removed and re-typed under `v: 1` without bumping `v`, and the rule is to
update `tools/maburtop.py` and `tools/flightreport.py` in the same commit.
Removals so far: 2026-08-12 `link.op.offset_qdb`,
`drone.applied.offset_qdb`, `drone.applied.derate_qdb` (constant-TX-power
note above); 2026-08-15 `link.attrib.on` (pooled-RF note in
`docs/link-adaptation.md`); 2026-08-29 `drone.applied.overhead` (singular)
→ `drone.applied.overhead_base`/`drone.applied.overhead_enh`, and
`link.streams` shrank from 4 entries to 2 (overhead scale break note
below); 2026-08-30 `link.op.overhead` → `link.op.overhead_base`/
`link.op.overhead_enh`, `link.ctl.rung.ov` → `link.ctl.rung.ov_base`/
`link.ctl.rung.ov_enh`, `link.ctl.ladder[].ov` →

→ `link.rungs[].ov_base`/`link.rungs[].ov_enh` (same-rate-fixed-pairs
scale-break note below); 2026-08-30 `link.deadline_ms` (the
`fec.decode_deadline_ms` row-expiry knob it mirrored was deleted after
the wall-2 bench measurement,
`docs/wall2-deadline-findings-2026-08-30.md` addendum — the video
decoders now rely on the seq horizon alone; MSP's SwDecoder keeps its
own 2 s expiry); 2026-09-02 `link.attrib.suppressed` (deleted with the
packet-level delivery window it was defined against — it counted windows
where the total and attributed packet views disagreed, a question the
symbol-based measure cannot ask; residual-phantom-demotes note below);
2026-09-04 `link.ctl.last_probe` (the discrete probe-attempt snapshot —
there is no discrete attempt any more, its live state is `link.probe`
instead), `counters.probes_started`/`probes_ok`/`probe_fails`/
`probe_aborts` (replaced by `counters.promotes_probed`/`probe_holds`),
`classes.s2`/`classes.s3` (removed, were always empty since the
2026-08-29 UEP flatten; `classes.probe` added) — probe-stream note below;
2026-09-21 `drone.sys.load` (was `/proc/loadavg[0]`, which on the
SigmaStar image counts the SDK's parked D-state workers and read a flat
~13 whether idle or pegged — never a CPU signal in any recording;
replaced by `drone.sys.cpu_pct`, the busy percent of the telemetry tick
from a `/proc/stat` delta, `null` on the first tick after a maburd
start); 2026-09-30 the telem diet (RC_VERSION 13, section below):
`drone.gen`, `drone.radio_rx_ok`, `drone.probing`, `drone.air_shed`,
`drone.air_backlog_max_ms`, `drone.air_shed_drops`, `drone.channel`,
`drone.hop_epoch`, `drone.applied` (the whole block),
`drone.enc.fps`/`mbps`/`roi_qp`/`ring_drops`/
`idr_disagree`/`enhance_disagree`/`vanished_base`/`vanished_enh`/
`self_idr_refused`/`venc_full_drops`/`venc_ring_fill_pct`/`idr_gs`,
`drone.txq.depth`/`cap`, `drone.radio.sent_pps`/`drops`,
`drone.sys.thermal_delta`; 2026-10-03 the channel set (section below):
`link.home`.
Removed keys are absent, not null. Keep appending to that list — not to protect
consumers, but because a recording made before a removal still carries the
key and `flightreport.py` still reads old recordings. The
sideport config lives in `/etc/maburgs.toml` under `stats`
(default-off in the shipped bundle; enabled on the bench GS).

**Scale break, 2026-08-04 — `classes.*.snr` is now dB, was half-dB.** The
sideport had been exporting devourer's raw half-dB SNR under a key
documented as dB, so every `classes.*.snr` (and the `snr_min`/`snr_max`
derived from it) in any recording made BEFORE that date reads exactly
2× the real figure. Recordings that span the change are not numerically
comparable and must not be pooled — a "9 dB improvement" across it is an
artifact. `flightreport.py` warns on the old scale — but that warning is a
BACKSTOP, not a detector: it fires only at `max(snr) > 60`, where the old
scale exceeds anything a real link produces. A normal 10–25 dB link reads
20–50 on the old scale and never trips it, and no threshold can do better,
because a pre-fix 48 (24 dB) and a post-fix 48 (an ordinary strong bench
link) are the same number with nothing in the schema to tell them apart.
**Silence from that warning means "not obviously old", never "confirmed
dB".** Date the recording instead — anything before 2026-08-04 is half-dB.
This is recorded here because it is the only committed, discoverable place:
the schema doc lives under gitignored `docs/superpowers/`.

`drone.uplink.snr_a`/`snr_b` had the SAME bug and were fixed the same day —
the drone's own receiver reads the uplink through the same devourer
`RxAtrib.snr`, and `telemetry.cpp` forwards it raw. Both are corrected at
the exporter, not at the source: the uplink's wire field is an `int8_t` the
drone `lround()`s, so halving before that rounding would quantize to whole
dB and lose half the resolution. Everything above about pre-2026-08-04
recordings applies to `drone.uplink.snr_*` too, and `flightreport.py` warns
on both with the same backstop threshold and the same caveat.

`classes.*.evm[_a|_b]` (added 2026-08-10) never had the bug: it is dB from
day one (devourer raw is the same half-dB family, halved at the exporter).
⚠ Raw EVM is op-point-dependent — the same clean bench link legitimately
reads −16 dB at mcs0 and −30 dB at mcs7, because per-MCS TX power moves the
PA between compression and linear regimes. Never compare EVM across rungs
or threshold it globally; use deviation from the same rung's baseline. The
sweep that established this (and the interpretation: walls stay
delivery-defined; EVM's job is per-rung baselines + live PA-compression
watchdog) is `docs/evm-sweep-findings-2026-08-10.md`.

**Scale break, 2026-08-29 — UEP overhead flatten.** `kUepRefOverhead`
changed {1.00, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25} → {1.00, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50}. Sideport
`streams[].ov` values and the ladder's utilization/`u` readings are on a
new scale from this date; per-stream ov in recordings before/after the
flag day is not comparable. Ladder thresholds (down_util etc.) were NOT
retuned. Same day: drone venc.resilience ltr:1 → rally (frame sizes
equalize; base/enh size split in older recordings is a preset artifact,
not a regression). Later the same day, s0 joined the flat ladder too
({0.50, 0.50, 0.50, 0.50}) — sideport s0 `ov` values change scale again.
See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-uep-flatten-rally-design.md`.

**Scale break, 2026-08-29 — overhead goes literal, streams collapse 4→2
(airtime-balance-uep, RC_VERSION 4).** LATER THE SAME DAY as the flatten
above, the wire's `fec_overhead` field changed meaning from a per-layer
`uep_layer_overhead`-scaled fraction to the LITERAL FEC command overhead
(`repair/data`) — old cmd × 2 = new actual. Every overhead-shaped value
in a recording from before this date is cmd-scale: **HALF the actual air
overhead a post-break recording of the same nominal number would carry.**
That covers `link.op.overhead`, `link.ctl.rung.ov`,
`link.ctl.ladder[].ov`, `link.streams[].ov`, `link.rungs[].ov` and the old
singular `drone.applied.overhead` (see the removal note above). The video
link collapsed from 4 UEP streams to 2 in the same change (BASE sid0 +
ENH sid1, `docs/link-adaptation.md`), so **a 4-entry `link.streams` array
is the shape signature of a pre-break recording** — `flightreport.py`
detects it (`streams` length) and LABELS the overhead values "cmd-scale
(x0.5 air)" rather than converting them, per the provenance policy in
CLAUDE.md: recordings outlive the code that wrote them, so a historical
number is read as what it was, never silently rescaled to match today's
meaning. A 2-entry array is post-break and needs no label.

⚠ The ×2 rescale is not the only wrinkle: the old ladder's config
overhead values were ALSO coarser than they looked. mcs6/mcs7 used to
read 0.15/0.10 — two visibly different numbers — but both collapsed to
the *same* repair-symbol count on the FEC's quantization grid, so their
actual on-air overhead was identically ~0.125 in every pre-break
recording (**0.10 ≡ 0.15 ≡ 0.125 on air**). The 2026-08-29 config bump
that doubled the nominal values (0.15→0.3, 0.10→0.2 — see
`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`) was not "just x2": it also resolved
that collision, so mcs6 and mcs7 now carry genuinely different overhead.
Do not back-compute a pre-break "real" overhead by simply halving a
post-break number for mcs6/mcs7 specifically — the halved figure lands
on the wrong side of the quantization collision. Every other rung is a
clean ×0.5.

**Scale break, 2026-08-30 — overhead splits into base/enh pairs
(same-rate-fixed-pairs); ctllog 8.** Every overhead-shaped sideport key
that used to carry ONE value per rung/op now carries a base/enh PAIR,
mirroring the RCF wire and per-rung config split landed the same day
(RC_VERSION 5, `gs/src/op_point.h`, `Rung::overhead_base/overhead_enh`):
`link.op.overhead` → `link.op.overhead_base`/`link.op.overhead_enh`;
`link.ctl.rung.ov` → `link.ctl.rung.ov_base`/`link.ctl.rung.ov_enh`;
`link.ctl.ladder[].ov` → `link.ctl.ladder[].ov_base`/
`link.ctl.ladder[].ov_enh`; `link.rungs[].ov` → `link.rungs[].ov_base`/
`link.rungs[].ov_enh`. A recording from before this date has ONE `ov`/
`overhead` number per rung where a post-break one has two — that is the
shape signature, the same detection idiom as the 2026-08-29 4→2 streams
collapse above. `link.streams[].ov` keeps its key (not renamed) — sid0
already read `overhead_base`-equivalent and sid1 `overhead_enh`-
equivalent before this date whenever telemetry was live, so only its
pre-telemetry fallback value changed (sid1 now falls back to
`overhead_enh` instead of `overhead_base`; a divergent enh rung was
silently masked as the base value until telemetry arrived, on any
recording from before this date with a gap at session start).

The maburgs ctl log's header line bumped `ctllog 7` → `ctllog 8` the
same day (`gs/src/ctl_log.h`): a HEADER-ONLY change — no S/E/P/N/R
per-tick line carries an overhead field at all, so nothing about a
recording's per-tick rows moved. Only the header's `ladder=` token
changed shape, from `<mcs>/<ov>,...` (one value per rung, ×100) to
`<mcs>/<ovb>:<ove>,...` (a base/enh pair, both ×100). `flightreport.py`
reads ctllog v1–v8: a pre-v8 log's single per-rung value is read as both
base and enh (that rung had no split to lose), and the tool prints a
NOTE on any log older than v8 saying so.

**2026-08-31: aucadence completion clock changed read-time → ring
`t_complete_us`; offsets recorded before this date fold in reader poll
latency (~0–0.5 ms one-sided).** `tools/bench/aucadence.py`'s per-AU
completion delay used to be `arrival_mono_us − pts`, where `arrival_mono_us`
was stamped by the ~0.5 ms poll loop that reads the ring's write index —
not the writer's own completion time, which SlotHdr v2 (2026-08-30) now
carries as `t_complete_us`. The tool switched to the ring-stamped clock the
same day the latency-accounting tools landed; the JSON output's `"clock"`
key records which basis produced a given capture (`"t_complete"` post-
switch, and a slot whose `t_complete_us` is 0 — pre-epoch writer, or a
caller that never passed `AuLatMeta` — still falls back to the old poll-time
basis, counted in `fallback_rows`). `tools/flightjitter.py`'s jitter-EMA
reproduction made the same switch: it now uses a row's `t_complete` (when
nonzero) as the inter-AU arrival basis instead of `au-NNNN.log`'s `t_us`
column, which is flightrec's own read-time stamp, same imprecision as the
old aucadence poll. Pre-2026-08-31 `--gate-ms` baselines and `flightjitter`
`jitter_ema_ms`/`residual_jitter_ms` numbers are not directly comparable to
post-switch ones for this reason — expect the poll-time noise floor (~0.5
ms) to shrink, not the underlying transport behavior to have changed.

**2026-08-31 (same day, later): the `air` segment's basis changed —
enc-excess fix.** The first deployed build computed `air` by clamping
`enc`/`dq` against the span above a capture-anchored floor, which
double-counted encode time (the floor already contained the floor frame's
encode) and pinned `air` at 0 in every clean capture from that build. The
fix anchors on the encode/queue-corrected arrival: `enc`/`dq` now report
their full wire values (previously clamped to the span) and `air` is real
transit excess. `e2e` (and the anchored floor) therefore shifted lower by
roughly the floor frame's `enc` (~2–4 ms) between the two same-day builds;
`link.video.lat` and player `lat:` numbers from the few hours in between
under-report `enc`/`dq`/`air` accordingly and show `air` ≈ 0 by
construction. Corrupt-body protection also landed with the fix: wire
`enc`/`dq` from FCS-failed bodies read as 0 = unknown from this point on.

au-NNNN.log rows grew 4 columns (`t_first t_complete enc dq`, SlotHdr v2's
latency fields) behind a `# aulog 2` marker line, written once at session
start by `flightrec.py`. A log without the marker is the old 7-column v1
format; `flightjitter.load_au_log` keys its row parsing on the marker's
presence, and a v1 row is padded with `t_first=t_complete=enc_us=dq_ms=0`
so the fec-wait class and the t_complete arrival-basis fallback both treat
"absent" the same as "present but zero".

**2026-09-06 (air clock): `# aulog 3`, SBI ver 2, SlotHdr v3.** AU rows
gain a 12th column, `air_ms` — the drone's modelled air backlog at the
AU's arrival (`AirClock`, `docs/link-adaptation.md`), carried in the SBI
body header (ver 2, 13-byte header; ver-1 bodies are rejected) and the AU
ring slot at offset 52 (`kAuRingVersion` 3). A row without the column
predates the model; `airdrain.py --model` says so instead of comparing.
`flightjitter.load_au_log` and `flightreport.load_aulog` ignore the extra
column. Recordings from the observe-only period (`air_clock.shed_ms` 0)
carry a live `air_ms` and zero `drone.air_shed_drops`; a non-zero drop
count means the gate was armed for that flight. Two caveats from the
first armed flight (`docs/air-clock-flight-findings-2026-09-06.md`
§5): the counter runs from link-up, so ground-time drops before takeoff
are in it (flight 0032 started at 12); and a missing enh AU in the AU
log is not a shed unless a neighbouring `air_ms` is near `shed_ms` —
~1 enh per rung transition is lost over RF, so `ausniff`'s missing-enh
count exceeds `air_shed_drops` on a lossy flight even with CONG off.
The `encoder.airtime_budget` flag day is 2026-09-06 as well: flights up
to `ctl-0351` / `au-0030` flew 0.6 (commanded `nominal/3`), from
`ctl-0352` / `au-0031` on 0.5 — `enc.cmd_kbps` in the flight jsonl says
which, and latency/air numbers across that break are not comparable.

**2026-08-31 (vsync servo): `reg`/`dsp` semantics change when
`display.vsync_lock` is on.** `reg` becomes hold-to-vblank (grows to
~½ panel period mean, up from the old D=12 dejitter hold); `dsp`
collapses to ≈ lead (`display.vsync_lead_ms`, default 6 ms) + flip
completion, down from the old 10–25 ms beat sweep. Their SUM is
comparable across the change — total release→latched time moves the way
the vsync-locked-regulator spec predicts — but the SPLIT between the two
segments is not: a `reg`/`dsp` pair from before this date and one from
after cannot be compared segment-by-segment, only as a sum, and only when
both recordings agree on `vsync_lock`. `lat-NNNN.log` (`# latlog 1`,
under `display.lat_log_dir`, default `/media/dvr/log`) starts existing at
this date — see `docs/observability.md` for its format. `lat:` lines from
before this date lived only in tmpfs (`/tmp/maburplay.log`) and are gone;
there is no way to recover the player tail segments for any flight
recorded before 2026-08-31.

**2026-08-31 (later, streaming push): `dq` changed meaning and scale —
~6 ms → ~0.** Before this date the drone stamped every body's
`enqueued_ms` at the TOP of the hot-loop iteration, so the wire `q_ms`
(→ player/flightrec `dq`, sideport `drone.txq_wait_ms`) spanned venc-ring
wait (~2.6 ms, fictitious — the frame did not exist yet) + FEC/SBI-pack
CPU (~3.4 ms) + true queue wait (~40 µs) — see
`docs/dq-spike-findings-2026-08-31.md`. After it, bodies stream to the
TxQueue as each seals, stamped at the actual push: `dq` is the true
TxQueue wait and reads ~0 in a healthy link; the pre-push CPU overlaps
the radio drain instead of preceding it, which also moved real latency —
same-config A/B on the bench: `e2e` p50 55.9 → 45.3 ms, `air` 2–3 → 0–1,
`reg` mean −2.6 (shallower vsync hold). A `dq` from before this date
cannot be compared to one after it at any scale; a healthy pre-change
recording shows `dq`≈6–7 where a healthy post-change one shows 0.
`dq` > a few ms now genuinely means TxQueue backlog.


**Scale break, 2026-09-02 — post-FEC residual is symbol abandonment, was
packet-seq gaps.** Everything that reports "residual"/"post-FEC loss"
changed what it counts: `link.residual_loss` and `link.attrib.residual_cur`
on the sideport, `resid`/`resid_cur` on the ctl log's S lines, `resid` on
its R lines, `link.layer_delivery_pct`, and the player OSD's post-loss row.

Before: `1 - delivered/expected` over a per-RCF-period window, from FRAG-seq
continuity of completed packets. That measure inferred loss from sequence
gaps, and a gap is indistinguishable from a unit that has not completed
*yet*. Sliding-window FEC completes a repaired unit *after* a later clean
one, so the next forward gap re-booked an already-delivered unit as a fresh
expectation. In a 50 ms window holding 3–6 units that reads as exactly
0.2500 or 0.3333.

After: `abandoned/expected` from the FEC decoder's own counters
(`SwDecoder::syms_abandoned`), which is seq arithmetic over a span and is
immune to arrival order. One formula for every consumer, in
`gs/src/ladder_residual.cpp`.

**Why recordings must be dated against this.** The old number was not a
noisy version of the new one — on a clean bench it was pure artifact. A
57-minute run on 2026-09-02 logged **200 `reason=residual` demotes with
`syms_abandoned` frozen at 139 across 6.2 M packets**, i.e. zero real
post-FEC loss the entire time, and `syms_recovered_arrived` (late originals)
= 218, tracking the demotes ~1:1. Consequences when reading pre-2026-09-02
data:

- A pre-break `resid > 0` does **not** mean video was lost. Do not pool
  per-rung `resid` across the boundary.
- Pre-break per-rung residual tables (including `flightreport.py`'s
  inversion callout) are contaminated by *reorder rate*, which scales with
  packet rate and therefore with rung — so they systematically overstate
  the high rungs. The "mcs5 is lossier" shape in older rung stores may be
  this artifact rather than PHY.
- Pre-break ladder behaviour is not comparable: the link could not hold a
  rung, so dwell-time-per-rung, promote/demote counts and time-at-max are
  all measuring the artifact.
- The ladder's demote input additionally narrowed from pooled base+enh to
  **BASE only** at the same date (the pooling was a 4-stream-era leftover);
  the S line still logs the pooled view.
- Post-break loss is booked ~80 ms later — a symbol counts abandoned only
  once the sliding-window horizon passes it (`seq_horizon` 512 at ~6.4 k
  sym/s). Sub-100 ms timing comparisons against pre-break recordings are
  not valid.

The ctl log self-identifies: `ctllog 9` and later are symbol-based, v1–v8
are packet-based, and `flightreport.py` prints a pre-v9 warning.

**Scale break, 2026-09-02 (link-rtt) — the OSD LAT headlines became
ABSOLUTE.** Before this date the burned-in `P50`/`P99` e2e (and `air+`)
were relative to the luckiest observed frame's transit — the anchor ate
the absolute network floor. After it, when `link.rtt.pts_off_us` is live
the player folds the floor (own anchor + telem-derived pts offset) into
`air+` AND the headline, so both read a few ms HIGHER than a pre-change
recording of the same link; the segments still sum to the headline. The
rows self-identify: a `~` prefix on the headline means the number is
still the old relative kind (offset estimator cold, or sync lost — the
floor freezes at last-good and drifts ~1 ms/min of outage). Sideport
`link.video.lat` is untouched — the fold-in is display-side only. A new
`RTT <n> ms` row above `P50` is control-path RTT (telem queues behind
video on the drone TX: reads high under saturation by design), never a
segment. Recordings' jsonl gains `link.rtt` the same date (additive).
Even absolute, the headlines still exclude sensor pre-pts (~10–16 ms
est.) and post-scanout display latency — only an LED/camera measurement
sees those.

**Burned-DVR shape change, 2026-09-06 — the LAT segment breakdown left
the screen.** Recordings burned before this date show each LAT row as
`P50 <e2e> | enc… dq… air+… fec… dec… reg… dsp…`; after it the rows read
`LAT P50 <e2e> ms` / `LAT P99 <e2e> ms`, right-flushed under `RTT`, with
no segments. This is a DISPLAY change only — no scale break, the same
frames and the same absolute e2e — but a burned-video comparison across
the date will look like data went missing. It did not: the segments are
in the flight jsonl `lat:` line for both eras, and the sideport
`link.video.lat` block is unchanged.

## 2026-09-03: per-card `loss_pct` phantom before the MSP seq fix

Recordings made before the MSP seq-walk fix (branch `msp-seq-fix`)
carry an inflated `cards[].loss_pct`: the GS excluded MSP bodies and
the drone's RC frames (DISC_ACK, T_TELEM) from the per-card 802.11 seq
walk on the (wrong) assumption that they carried their own counters. The
chip stamps ONE hardware seq on every frame it injects (EN_HWSEQ), so
each such frame booked one phantom lost frame. At the bench's ~5–10 MSP
+ ~2 RC frames/s over ~2300 bodies/s that is ~0.3–0.5 percentage points
of phantom on top of the real figure (0.67 % reported vs ~0.35 % real,
2026-09-02). `pre_fec_loss` and every ladder input are unaffected. When
comparing `loss_pct` across the fix, subtract the non-video rate
(`cards[].classes.msp.pps + ctrl.pps`, over `inj_pps`) from the old
values, or compare `pre_fec_loss` instead.


## 2026-09-03: `drone.enc.qp` changes meaning; `roi_qp` and `congestion_shed` added

Before this date the sideport key `drone.enc.qp` (Telem byte `qp`) was
RcAgent's **ROI QP override** (`actuator.last_roi_qp`, 0 = normal,
`encoder.roi_qp_low` when the bitrate sat under `roi_threshold_kbps`).
It read 0 for whole flights and says nothing about the encoder's rate
control — flight-0011's analysis fell for exactly that
(`docs/handover-venc-overshoot-2026-09-03.md`). From this date
`drone.enc.qp` is the **encoder's QP** for the last frame it published
(venc `startQual`, 0 = unavailable — host build or no frame yet) and the
override lives in the new `drone.enc.roi_qp` (signed). Do not compare a
`qp` column across the date: an old recording's 0 is "ROI normal", a new
recording's 30-ish is a real QP. `drone.congestion_shed` (Telem flags
bit4) is additive the same day: true while the drone-local
TxQueue-pressure / USB-failure shed holds the enh layer, absent (not
false) in older recordings — an enh gap in a pre-date recording cannot be
attributed to congestion after the fact.

**Same night: `drone.enc.qp` deleted.** The encoder `startQual` it was
re-pointed at reads 0 on every frame this firmware emits (no
`GetChnStat` QP exists either), so the key and the Telem byte behind it
were removed rather than shipped as a permanent 0 (Telem 84 → 83). The
only recordings with a non-zero `drone.enc.qp` would be from the few
hours between the two changes, and would still be 0. `roi_qp` and
`congestion_shed` stay. `vencprobe` captures from that window carry a 3rd
`s,` column (always 0 or −1); both analyzers tolerate its absence.


## 2026-09-04: `link.pre_fec_loss` added (a gauge, not the ladder's number)

Additive: recordings before this date have no `link.pre_fec_loss` and
only the in-ctl `link.ctl.pre_fec_loss`. The two are NOT interchangeable
and neither replaces the other.

- `link.ctl.pre_fec_loss` is the last s1 sample the **ladder controller
  acted on**. `LadderController::update()` returns early on a starved or
  `!sample_valid` window (`gs/src/ladder_controller.cpp`), so through
  those windows this key **holds its previous value**. It is null in
  static-pin mode, where the controller is never ticked at all.
- `link.pre_fec_loss` is that poll's **raw measured** s1 window loss,
  exported unconditionally alongside the post-FEC `link.residual_loss`.
  It is null when the window produced no valid sample, and — the reason
  it exists — it is present in static-pin mode.

Expect them to differ by a fraction of a poll's worth of drift while the
ladder runs (bench 2026-09-04: 0.01029 vs 0.01001 on the same datagram),
and to diverge properly across a starved run. Prefer the ctl figure when
reconstructing a ladder decision; prefer the gauge when asking what the
link was actually doing, and use it exclusively for pinned flights.

Before this date the player's OSD read the rung and the pre-FEC half of
its LOSS row **only** from `link.ctl`, so both rendered as em-dashes for
the entire duration of any `link.static_mcs >= 0` flight. A pinned
recording from before 2026-09-04 therefore shows a blank MCS/FEC/LOSS-pre
OSD in its burned DVR video while the jsonl beside it has the real values
in `link.op` — the display was wrong, the data was not.

## 2026-09-04: `venc.resilience` deleted; the encoder structure is six keys

The drone config key `venc.resilience` — a string naming a row in a preset
table (`rally`, `fpv`, `ltr:<N>`, …) that expanded into intra-refresh and
SVC-T settings — no longer exists. A config still carrying it fails boot on
the unknown-key path. Its components are now config keys of their own, each
one an MI struct field verbatim:

| was, inside the preset | is now |
|---|---|
| intra mode name → target ms → CTU rows/P | `venc.intra_refresh_rows` (rows/P directly, 0 = off) |
| per-mode stripe QP (36/32/28) | `venc.intra_refresh_qp` |
| `ref_base` / `ref_enhance` / `ref_pred` | `venc.ref_base` / `venc.ref_enhance` / `venc.ref_pred` |
| preset-pinned GOP | `venc.gop_s`, which is now always authoritative |

The shipped values (`rows 4, qp 36, base 1, enhance 1, pred true, gop_s
2.0`) are what `rally` expanded to at 1080p60, so **recordings either side
of this date are directly comparable** — the encoder structure did not move,
only the way it is spelled. Two behaviour changes worth knowing when reading
older material:

- The preset path **clamped** an over-wide stripe to the picture height and
  warned on stderr; config now refuses to boot instead. No flown config ever
  hit the clamp.
- **2026-09-27: `venc.intra_refresh_rows` → `venc.intra_refresh_frames`.**
  The key is now the sweep length in frames; the pipeline derives rows/P as
  ceil(CTU rows / frames) from the encoded height (so the boot-time bound
  above is gone too). The encoder output is unchanged for the values in
  use: rows 34 at 1080p = frames 1, rows 4 at 1080p = frames 9 (the
  default). The boot log's `intraRefresh: rows=R/T` line reads the same.
- Auto-GOP (one IDR per full stripe sweep, when no explicit GOP was set) is
  gone. It was unreachable in mabur for its whole life — every preset pinned
  a GOP — so no recording was ever produced under it.
- **`venc.gop_s` was previously MASKED and is now authoritative.** Under the
  preset path `gop_sec` was `preset.gop_overridden ? preset.gop_s :
  cfg->gop_s`, and every named preset set `gop_overridden` — so whatever
  `venc.gop_s` a config carried alongside `resilience: "rally"` was ignored
  and 2.0 s was used. It takes effect from this date. The bundle already
  says 2.0, but a deployed drone config is known to diverge from the bundle
  (see `handover-venc-overshoot-2026-09-03.md`: `max_ipprop` 2 deployed vs 0
  in the bundle), so **read `venc.gop_s` out of the drone's live
  `/etc/mabur.toml` before swapping** — anything but 2.0 changes the IDR
  interval on this deploy, with nothing in the boot log calling it out.
- The `rescue` preset's 0.25 s GOP is no longer expressible. It wrote
  `gop_sec` directly and so bypassed the `venc.gop_s` range check, whose
  floor is 0.5 s. The IDR-spam escape hatch is gone; nothing flew on it.

Mentions of `venc.resilience ltr:1 → rally` and of the "rally preset" in
the notes above and in `venc-ring-vanish-findings-2026-08-12.md` describe
configs that produced data on the DVR. They stay accurate about that data;
they just name a key that is no longer settable.

## 2026-09-04: probe stream replaces the discrete s3 probe — RC_VERSION 6, ctllog 10

The s3 probe-before-promote design (2026-08-05) is gone: the drone no
longer moves the whole ENH stream to a candidate MCS for 2 s per promote
attempt. Instead it always sends a dedicated probe-stream canary body
(SBI stream id 5) behind every ENH access unit, at the MCS of rung
`current + link.probe.rung_offset`, and the ladder's promote trigger
reads a continuous verdict instead of starting a discrete probe. Detail
in `docs/link-adaptation.md` "Probe stream". RCF gains a fixed
`probe_profile` byte (`RCF_F_PROBE_ENH`/`CAP_ENH_PROBE`/`CAP_S3_PROBE`
deleted); RC_VERSION 5 → 6 — a drone/GS pair must be swapped together
(`docs/deploy.md`).

Sideport (schema `v: 1`, unchanged): REMOVED `link.ctl.last_probe`,
`counters.probes_started/probes_ok/probe_fails/probe_aborts`,
`classes.s2`, `classes.s3` (the last two were always empty since the
2026-08-29 UEP flatten — no data lost). ADDED `counters.promotes_probed`,
`counters.probe_holds`, `classes.probe`, and the `link.probe` block
(gate state, rung/mcs, streak, union + per-card loss and counts — see
`docs/observability.md`).

**Scale break: `link.rungs[].probe_u`/`probe_n` change from a discrete
per-attempt sample to a continuous EWMA.** Before this date a rung's
`probe_u` was the last COMPLETED 2 s discrete probe's utilization at that
rung — one sample roughly every few minutes, only while a promote to
that rung was actually being attempted. From this date it is the same
`RungStore` field fed by the always-on gate, updating at ~20 samples/s
continuously while that rung is the commanded probe candidate. **Do not
pool `probe_u`/`probe_n` populations across this date**: a pre-date
`probe_n` of a few tens means a handful of discrete attempts: a post-date
one of the same magnitude means well under a second of continuous
sampling. The `age_s` column next to it in the `R` ctl-log line is
unaffected — `age_s` was always wall-clock time since the last sample.

**`ctllog 10`'s `P` line is REPURPOSED, not just reformatted.** Through
v9 a `P` row was one discrete probe ATTEMPT outcome (`pass|fail|abort`)
written once per 2 s probe. From v10 it is a GATE-STATE EDGE
(`clean|lossy|noinfo`) written every time
`LadderController::probe_gate()`'s state changes — a continuous-state
transition, not an attempt outcome. `flightreport.py`'s wall-fit maps
`clean→pass, lossy→fail, noinfo→abort` for the per-rung wall report, but
a v9-vs-v10 P-row COUNT is not the same kind of number (attempts vs
edges) and must not be pooled. The `E` line's reason vocabulary gains
`promote_probed` (a probe-gated promote); existing reasons are
unchanged. `R`'s `probe_u`/`probe_n` line position is unchanged but
carries the new continuous meaning above from this date.

## 2026-09-05: `u`, `u3`, `link.pre_fec_loss`, `link.ctl.util` are arrival-booked — ctllog 11

Scale break, not additive. Before this deploy the ladder's pre-FEC
util number was `1 − (delivered + recovered_arrived) / (delivered +
recovered + abandoned_cur)` from the FEC decoder's completion counters:
a lost symbol entered it only when repaired or given up on (a repair
window to ~80 ms late), and right after a rung change the first bucket
had almost no deliveries, so a handful of repairs read as 50–100 %
(flight-0023's two `probation` demotes at +151/+160 ms; bench ctl-0299
u = 1.125). Since ctllog 11 the number is `1 − arrived/expected` from
`SwDecoder`'s `ArrivalTracker`: `expected` is sequence advance past a
32-seq settle line, `arrived` is what was heard, both booked at arrival,
current-only via the transition watermark. Consequences for readers:

- `u`/`u3` on S lines, `u` on util/probation E lines, `link.pre_fec_loss`,
  `link.ctl.util`/`util3` and the RungStore `u` columns read LOWER and
  SMOOTHER across transitions and react sooner to a fade. Do not pool
  them across the ctllog 10/11 boundary; `flightreport.py` prints which
  definition a log used.
- New `link.streams[].arr_*` keys (cumulative). The old
  `recovered`/`recovered_arrived`/`abandoned` keys stay and still describe
  decoder completion; they are no longer what the ladder acts on.
- The 150 ms util settle blank is gone; the residual blank stays.

## 2026-09-06 — debug-log consolidation, and the au-log clock break

`au.log`'s `# aulog 4` marker means its leading `t_us` column is
CLOCK_MONOTONIC µs. In `aulog 1..3` — written by the retired
`flightrec.py`, which read the ring from outside maburgs — it was WALL-clock
µs, and the file carried `# sync <wall_us> <t_ms>` anchors every 10 s so
`flightjitter.py` could bridge to the jsonl's monotonic `t_ms`. Do not pool
`t_us` across the version boundary, and do not assume a v4 log has any
`# sync` line. `lat.log`'s `# latlog 2` drops its own `# sync` header for the
same reason.

Recordings made before this change are three independent session counters
across two directories (`/media/dvr/ctl-NNNN_<date>.log` and
`/media/dvr/log/{au,flight,lat}-NNNN.*`), which is why pairing them needs
mono-span overlap and `last_event` identity. Sessions from `NNNN/` onward
need none of that: one directory is one session.

A format marker line may appear more than once in a v4/v2 file — each
daemon restart within a session appends and re-states its header, including
a `header_info` that may have changed. Parsers must treat a repeated marker
as a re-statement, not as the start of a new file.

## 2026-09-20 — every recording now opens with a low-power segment

Low-power (disarmed) mode (`docs/link-adaptation.md`) runs the encoder at
`low_power.bitrate_kbps` / `low_power.fps` — the bundle ships 1 Mb/s and
15 fps — from boot until the FC's first ARMED report. On a normal flight
that is the whole ground phase: power-on, radio link-up, taxi/hover checks,
every second before the arm. So from this date **every recording begins
with a leading segment that is not flight data**, and it is usually the
longest single-operating-point stretch in the file.

What differs across the arm boundary, in the same recording:

- **Bitrate.** Capped at 1 Mb/s (a `min()` against the ladder's budget, so
  the rung's own number is not what the encoder was given). Every
  bitrate-derived figure — `drone.enc.*`, the player's measured `mbps`, AU
  sizes in `au.log` — reads at the cap, not at the rung.
- **Frame rate, and therefore body rate.** 15 fps instead of 60. Anything
  counted per body or per AU changes rate by 4x without any link event
  behind it: `au.log` row cadence, probe canaries (one per enh AU),
  jitter/latency percentiles computed over a fixed number of samples, and
  the ladder's body-counted promote windows.
- **GOP frame count.** `venc_set_fps` rescales the GOP from `venc.gop_s`
  rather than keeping the frame count, so a 0.5 s GOP is 8 frames in low
  power and 30 at full rate. An IDR-interval histogram is bimodal in
  frames and unimodal in seconds.
- **Ladder rung.** The ladder converges against roughly 1/8 the offered
  load for the whole segment, so a pre-arm rung is not comparable to an
  in-flight rung at the same label (see the arm-transition bullet in
  `docs/link-adaptation.md`).

`drone.low_power` (sideport, Telem flags bit7) is true for exactly this
segment and is the marker to split on; the drone `stats:` line carries
`lp=`/`armed=` and `rc: low_power ENTER/EXIT` brackets it in stderr.
**`tools/flightreport.py` does not know about any of this** — it neither
excludes nor annotates the segment, so a whole-file mean of bitrate, fps,
AU size or rung silently mixes the two operating points. The exclusion is
**manual** for now: find the `drone.low_power` false-edge in the jsonl (or
the `rc: low_power EXIT (armed)` line) and compare only what follows it.

Recordings from before this date have no `drone.low_power` key at all and
no leading segment — they are full power throughout, and absence of the
key means "older build", not "full power confirmed".

## 2026-09-24 — 40 MHz rungs: ctllog 12, scanlog 3, per-width config keys

Full detail: `docs/bw40.md`.

- **`ctllog 12`.** The ctl.log header's `ladder=` token gains a `bw:` prefix
  per rung (`ladder=bw:mcs/ovb:ove,...`); `ctllog 11` and earlier have no
  prefix and every rung is implicitly 20 MHz. `tools/bench/switchloss.py`
  parses the prefix but still keys rungs by MCS only.
- **`scanlog 3`.** Bumped from `scanlog 2`: the `D` dwell line gains a
  trailing `bw` column (the dwell's tuned width — 20 during a boot scan,
  `radio.width` in an in-flight session), and the `K` pick line gains a
  trailing `pair=<lo>+<hi>|-` (the picked channel's standard 40 MHz pair, or
  `-`). A `scanlog 2` file has neither column.
- **Removed drone config keys:** `air_clock.efficiency` → `efficiency_20` /
  `efficiency_40`; `ampdu.min_mcs` → `min_mcs_20` / `min_mcs_40` — both keyed
  by width, not a single table/threshold. No migration; an old key fails
  boot.
- **New GS config key:** `link.ladder[].bw`, required (20 or 40) — a rung is
  now `(bw, mcs)`, not just `mcs`. A pre-2026-09-24 `[[link.ladder]]` block
  with no `bw` fails boot rather than defaulting to 20.

## 2026-09-25 — NHM airtime evidence: scanlog 4

Full detail: `docs/inflight-channel-hop.md` §2/§3/§8,
`docs/channel-select.md` ("`scan.log`"), `docs/bw40.md`,
`docs/nhm-airtime-spike-findings-2026-09-25.md` (the measured defaults).

- **`scanlog 4`.** Bumped from `scanlog 3`:
  - `V`'s per-card block grows from 7 fields to 9: `foreign fa cca crc rssi
    snr drssi` gains a trailing `nhm_busy` (`-` when the card's NHM window
    didn't cover this verdict window on this channel) and `own_air` (always
    present, % of the window, never `-`).
  - `D` gains a further trailing `busy` column (NHM busy % over the dwell's
    observe span, `-` when the card has no NHM or the read was invalid) —
    on top of `scanlog 3`'s `bw` column, so a `scanlog 4` `D` line has one
    more field than a `scanlog 3` one and two more than `scanlog 2`.
  - `K`'s per-channel entries **reshape**, not just extend: `scanlog 3`'s
    `ch:worst_busy[:floor]` (floor bracket-optional) becomes
    `ch:worst_busy:floor:busy`, with `floor` now always present (a number or
    `nan`) and `busy` appended (`-` when invalid) — a `scanlog 3` parser
    that assumed a variable 2-or-3-field entry will misparse a `scanlog 4`
    line. `tools/flightreport.py` reads `scanlog 3` and `4`.
- **New GS config keys:** `[hop.verdict] busy_dbm = -83` (must sit on an
  `nf::kNhmAbsThDbm` bucket edge — config validation rejects any other
  value) and `blocked_pct = 50` (the design spec's own draft carried a
  provisional 30; the hw spike replaced it before shipping). Both are
  wholly new keys with defaults, so an old config without them boots
  unchanged.
- **New evidence bit and verdict rule:** `kEvBlocked` (hex `0x20`) in `V`'s
  `evidence_hex` column — a `scanlog 3` recording's evidence hex never has
  this bit set, since the code that could set it did not exist yet, not
  because the channel was never blocked. `blocked` also changes which
  windows classify `interfered`: a window reading `unknown` under a
  pre-2026-09-25 build could read `interfered` on the identical air under
  the new one if it also has NHM evidence, so verdict-histogram counts
  (`flightreport.py`'s HOP section) are not comparable across the break.
- **Sideport:** `cards[i].energy` gains `busy_pct`/`own_air_pct` (both
  `null` on an older maburgs or before the first verdict window lands);
  `tools/maburtop.py` gains a per-card `fbusy` column (renamed from `air%`
  in the final-review fix wave: it was always foreign busy, never own
  airtime) (`max(0, busy_pct − own_air_pct)`). See `docs/observability.md`.

## 2026-09-30 — telem diet: RC_VERSION 13, Telem 98 → 48 bytes

`T_TELEM` dropped every field no GS consumer read — link control, the
player OSD, the web UI, `flightreport.py` / `flightjitter.py` — leaving
the ones that were maburtop-only on the wire nowhere. A **flag day**: a
v12 drone and a v13 GS (or the reverse) do not parse each other's RC
frames at all (`docs/deploy.md`).

- **Removed Telem fields:** `generation`, `enc_frames`, `enc_kbytes`,
  `roi_qp`, `ring_drops`, `idr_disagree`, `enhance_disagree`,
  `vanished_base`, `vanished_enh`, `self_idr_refused`, `venc_full_drops`,
  `venc_ring_fill_pct`, `txq_depth`, `txq_cap`, `radio_sent`,
  `radio_drops`, `air_backlog_max_ms`, `air_shed_drops`, `thermal_delta`,
  `channel`, `hop_epoch`, `applied_profile`, `applied_ov_base`,
  `applied_ov_enh`, `idr_gs`, and flag bits 1 (`radio_rx_ok`), 2
  (`probe_on`), 5 (`air_shed`). The drone-side counters still exist; most still print
  on maburd's own 5 s `frame_ring:` stderr line.
- **Removed sideport keys:** the list above. A recording before this date
  still carries them; nothing in-repo reads them any more.
- **Where the evidence went:** per-frame air backlog was always in the SBI
  `air_ms` → `au.log` column 12 (finer than the 1 Hz window max);
  "drone heard nothing" is `drone.radio.rx` own + foreign + crcfail = 0
  (maburtop derives its `DEAF` cell from it); the drone's channel is
  whichever channel its video arrives on (`link.channel`, `scan.log` `H`
  lines); `link.streams[].ov` is now always the commanded op pair (it only
  ever differed from the applied echo under the bench `:8301` override); a
  web spotter's link setting is its configured width, no MCS; a web GS sees
  for itself whether a requested key frame arrived, so the drone's served
  count (`drone.enc.idr_gs`) went too.
- **Exporter restart detection** used `generation` regressing as its
  second signal; it now uses `drone.rcf_rx` / `drone.txq.drops`
  regressing. Rates (`drone.rcf.rx_pps`, `drone.txq.drop_pps`) are
  unaffected otherwise.
- **`flightreport.py` DRONE TX PATH** (new section): txq wait p50/p90/max,
  txq drops and USB fails as summed per-period growth, CPU p50/p90/max,
  congestion/failsafe shed period counts — once per `tlm_seq`. It reads
  keys that predate the diet, so it also reports on older recordings.

## 2026-10-01 — link pairing: RC_VERSION 14, vtx_id deleted, auth tag

Every GS→drone RC frame (DISC, RCF, CAL_CMD, CAL_RESULT) carries an 8-byte
SipHash-2-4 tag before its CRC; DISC_ACK carries `vtx_nonce` + a flags byte.
`vtx_id` is gone from every frame and both configs. A **flag day**.
`docs/link-pairing.md`.

- **Removed sideport key:** `link.vtx_id`.
- **New sideport keys:** `link.key_fp` (string: `default` or 4 hex),
  `link.state` gains the value `key_mismatch`, `drone.auth_reject` (bool,
  Telem flags bit1 — bit1 was `radio_rx_ok` until 2026-09-30, so a
  recording between those dates reads bit1 as the old meaning).
- **Removed config keys:** `link.vtx_id` on both ends. **New:**
  `link.key_file` on both ends, `link.key` (inline hex, web overlay only) on
  the GS. An old config fails boot.
- `ctllog 12` unchanged; the KEY MISMATCH state is in `flight.jsonl` via
  `link.state`, not in `ctl.log`.


## 2026-10-02 — relay cards: `cards[i].kind`, null SNR, TX selector on RSSI

`maburgs` can run a CPE510 `mabur-relay` unit as a card (`[radio] relays`,
`docs/cpe510-relay.md`). No wire change, no flag day, no new log marker.

- **New sideport keys:** `cards[i].kind` (`"usb"` | `"relay"`) on every
  card, and `cards[i].relay` (eleven keys, `docs/observability.md`) on
  relay cards only. A recording before this date has no `kind`: every card
  in it is USB.
- **Null SNR/EVM on a relay card.** From this build on a recording may
  carry a card with `kind: "relay"` whose per-class `snr`/`snr_a`/`snr_b`/
  `evm*` are always `null` while its `rssi*` are real — the relay's "SNR"
  is RSSI above a calibrated floor, so it is not exported. Card ids are
  roster order (USB first, relays after), so a relay's id is
  `n_usb + k`. `tools/flightreport.py` already tolerates null per-card SNR
  (its sideport SNR readers take numbers only or print nothing; a relay's
  `probe.log` rows carry `nan` SNR, which the probe stats already exclude);
  it ignores `relay`.
- **TX selector compares RSSI, not SNR — on every GS, relay or not.**
  `TxSelector` picks the uplink card on best-chain RSSI with a true 3 dB
  margin (2 s hold and the dead-card rule unchanged). Before, it compared
  `snr_ema` in raw half-dB units against the same `3.0`, so the effective
  margin was **1.5 dB** of SNR. A flight's `link.tx_card` switches (and
  which card held the uplink) are not comparable across this line.
- **Boot-scan DISC beacons leave the first non-scout card** (`boot_home_card`
  in `gs/src/main.cpp` at the time; renamed `boot_scout_card` by the
  2026-10-03 channel set below — same variable, same rule), not a
  hard-coded card 0. On an all-USB GS that is still card 0; with one USB
  card plus a relay the relay beacons on home while the USB card scans.

## 2026-10-03 — channel set: scanlog 5, link.home removed

Home channel + candidates is replaced by one shared channel set,
`radio.channels`, on both ends. A "home" channel no longer exists as a
concept: the drone parks on its remembered member (or the first) and only
ever moves on a GS proposal, a GS order, or an unconfirmed move back to
where it came from — never to a privileged fallback channel. Full detail:
`docs/channel-select.md`.

- **`scanlog 5`.** Bumped from `scanlog 4`. The header line reshapes from
  `home=<n> candidates=<c1,c2,...> dwell_ms=<n> min_rounds=<n>
  enable=<0|1> cards=<n>` to `channels=<c1,c2,...> mode=<auto|pinned>
  dwell_ms=<n> min_rounds=<n> cards=<n>` — no `home=`, no `enable=`
  (`radio.scan.enable` is gone), a `mode=` token in its place. `C`/`D`/`K`
  record shapes are unchanged from
  `scanlog 4`. `M`'s reason vocabulary **loses** `split_home` and
  `reunite` — there is nothing to split from or reunite to any more — and
  keeps `commit`/`ack_override` plus the in-flight hop's
  `hop_lead`/`hop_follow`/`hop_withdraw`/`hop_one_card`. `H`'s kind
  vocabulary **gains** `boot_order`: the one-time boot hop placed through
  `HopController` while the boot pick is open, alongside the in-flight
  hop's `order`/`verify_fail`/`escape`. A `scanlog 4` or earlier
  recording's `M` lines may carry `split_home`/`reunite` and its `H` lines
  never carry `boot_order` — read both as what they were.
  **2026-10-04, marker unchanged:** `boot_order` is renamed `relocate`
  (any order moving the link to where it should live — the pin or the
  boot pick — after the link formed where the drone was found; only the
  pre-merge 2026-10-03 bench builds wrote `boot_order`, and flightreport
  reads both), `M` gains `link_found` (the link formed on the member the
  drone's ack was heard on), and the sideport's `scan.pick` is latched at
  the freeze instead of following the live op (before, it moved with
  every hop).
  `tools/flightreport.py` reads `scanlog 5` and still parses `split_home`
  out of an older-marker file.
- **Removed sideport key:** `link.home` (the configured home channel —
  there is no home to report). `link.channel` is unchanged: the live
  channel of the GS's TX card.
- **Removed GS config keys:** `radio.channel` as a bare number (home),
  `radio.scan.enable`, `radio.scan.candidates`, `radio.scan.home_window_ms`,
  `radio.scan.split_after_ms`, `radio.scan.home_margin`. **Removed drone
  config keys:** `radio.channel`, `radio.follow_gs`. **New, both ends:**
  `radio.channels` (the set, 1-8 members); GS only: `radio.channel =
  "auto"` (a string now, not a number) or a member to pin, plus
  `radio.scan.search_ms`/`op_window_ms`/`pick_margin`/`one_card_ms`/
  `max_ms`. No `RC_VERSION` bump — `Disc.op_channel`/
  `DiscAck.agreed_channel` and `Rcf.hop_ch`/`hop_epoch` are unchanged wire
  fields, now read over the whole set instead of a single home channel.
- **State files, new:** `/etc/mabur.channel` (drone), `/etc/maburgs.channel`
  (GS) — the remembered member, decimal text. Neither existed before this
  date; their absence on an older recording's device is simply "older
  build," not a fault.
- **`tools/maburtop.py`:** drops the `h{home}` field; shows `scan.state`
  (now including `moving`, the boot pick's relocation in flight) and
  `scan.rounds`.

## 2026-10-04 — pin is static: `hop.enable` deleted, no more `would_` rows, sideport `hop.enable` gone

- `scan.log` `H` rows prefixed `would_` (shadow hops, `hop.enable = false`)
  appear only in sessions recorded before this date. `flightreport.py`'s
  SHADOW HOP REPORT path stays for them; no later build emits one.
- **Removed sideport key:** `hop.enable`. Pinned reads `scan.state == "off"`
  (so does a relay-only roster, which in auto is still reactive on its
  one-card path); the authoritative mode is the `scanlog 5` header's
  `mode=<auto|pinned>`.
- **Removed GS config keys:** `hop.enable`, `hop.scout_when_disabled`;
  `hop.verdict.busy_dbm`/`blocked_pct` are `radio.scan.busy_dbm`/
  `blocked_pct`. A session's `scanlog 5` header is unchanged
  (`mode=<auto|pinned>` already names the only mode knob).
- **Behaviour break for comparisons:** a pinned flight before this date
  could hop (and its `scan.pick` then disagreed with `link.channel`); after
  it a pinned flight never hops, and its `cards[i].dwell` stays `null`
  (no in-flight dwells). `docs/channel-select.md` "Which knob drives which
  piece".

## 2026-10-05 — CPE relay interference sweep/hop: scanlog 6

Relay protocol v4 (`../mabur-openwrt`) adds `SURVEY`/`SCAN`/`SCAN_RESULT`,
which lets a CPE510 relay card feed the in-flight hop verdict and the hop
ranker; full detail: `docs/cpe510-relay.md` "Interference + hop on a
relay", `docs/inflight-channel-hop.md` §2/§3/§8.

- **`scanlog 6`.** Bumped from `scanlog 5`: `D` gains a further trailing
  `<rx|->` (a relay sweep entry's rx % of the observe span; `-` for a USB
  dwell, which has no rx reading, or an invalid relay reading) — on top of
  `scanlog 4`'s `busy` column, so a `scanlog 6` `D` line has one more field
  than a `scanlog 4`/`5` one. `C`/`K`/`M`/`V`/`H` are unchanged by this
  bump. A relay sweep's `D` records come from the relay card (its `C`
  record's positional `chip` field reads `ath9k`), carry `in_session=1`
  and an `observe_ms` around 20 (the sweep's requested `observe_ms`,
  `kSweepObserveMs`) rather than the USB dwell's 5. `tools/flightreport.py`
  reads the new field
  (`load_scanlog`'s `D` branch); a `scanlog 5` or earlier file has no `rx`
  column and the parser reads it as `None` rather than misparsing the
  line.
- **New sideport keys:** `cards[i].relay` gains `tx_scan_drop` (owner `TX`
  frames the relay dropped mid-sweep) and `sweeps` (`SCAN`s this card has
  sent); `hop` gains `sweep_timeouts` (relay `SCAN`s that got no
  `SCAN_RESULT` before their request-derived timeout, cumulative per
  maburgs process; added in the final-review fix wave, same date) —
  `docs/observability.md`. A recording before 2026-10-05 has none of the
  three; absent means "not recorded", not 0.

## 2026-10-10 — slice salvage: salvaged AUs reach the glass

From 2026-10-10 maburplay (and the web GS) decode slice-salvaged AUs
(`kRecFlagSliceSalvaged`, `docs/slices.md`) instead of skipping the
damaged AU. Those frames now reach the glass and are timed, so the LAT /
e2e latency distribution during loss includes frames that before
2026-10-10 were skipped and never measured — typically the late ones
that waited out `gap_ms`. A latency tail that grew across this date is
not by itself a regression: compare flights across it knowingly, and
split by `au.log`'s salvage columns (`# aulog 5`) where it matters.
