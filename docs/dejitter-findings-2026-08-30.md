# Dejitter findings — vsync straddles, the class offset, and the display regulator

2026-08-30. Post-flight analysis of the pair-A/B recordings (`au-0028`
flat 50:50, `au-0029` asym 100:50 — same flights as
`pair-ab-field-findings-2026-08-30.md`) asking: what does the operator's
in-flight "jitter/stutter" actually consist of, and what removes it at
the least latency? Method: detrend the per-AU completion delay
(`t_us − pts` per segment, linear clock fit), then simulate the real
mailbox presenter against a 60 Hz vsync grid, phase-averaged (the
sensor and panel clocks free-run, so the phase sweeps in real flight).

## What the stutter is

- **~758 (0028) / ~942 (0029) repeat+skip pairs per minute** — a frame
  shown twice then a frame skipped, 13–16 per second. Near-continuous
  micro-judder, ~100× more frequent than flightjitter's >25 ms stutter
  *events*. A frame 2 ms late past a vsync boundary straddles just as
  visibly as a 20 ms one.
- **The largest single component is deterministic**: base completes
  6.4 ms (flat) / 9.1 ms (asym) later than enh in every pair — SVC-T
  reference frames simply carry more bytes, and the asym pair's extra
  base overhead added air on top. Equalizing only this class offset
  removes 33–47% of all repeats. (Independently confirms flat > asym.)
- Completion delay above floor: p50 12–15 ms, p90 23–31 ms, p99
  **78–97 ms**. The tail is rung-change sawtooth / loss recovery /
  holes — no display-side mechanism reaches it.
- Clock beat floor: the sensor runs 59.939 fps effective vs the 60.000
  panel → ~3.7 unavoidable slips/min. Irrelevant at current levels.
  (2026-10-09: the flights on the current firmware measure the camera at
  60.078 fps, faster than the panel — 4.7 slips/min, a frame thrown away
  each; `docs/efficient-link-plan.md` step 2.)

## Why a pts-anchored display regulator (and not TX pacing)

Simulated on the recorded arrivals, release at `floor(pts) + D`, late
frames shown immediately:

| scenario | 0028 rep/min | 0029 rep/min | added mean latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| today (mailbox) | 758 | 942 | — |
| D = 12 ms | ~419 | ~640 | +2.3 / +1.7 ms |
| D = 16 ms | 249 | 427 | +4.9 / +3.6 ms |
| class-eq + D = 16 | 205 | 289 | +4.7 / +3.4 ms |

The regulator absorbs the class offset automatically (the early class
just waits longer), so the last row's gain arrives without touching UEP
— and inverse overhead pairs are ruled out anyway (base keeps ≥ enh
protection, operator rule). TX-side pacing to the same schedule pays
identical latency *before* the radio, where fades stack on top, and
destroys catch-up slack: strictly worse. A D past ~16–20 ms buys little
— the tail is not reachable by any fixed D.

FEC interaction: none. The delivery walls (seq horizon ≈ 270 ms of
traffic at 10 Mb/s; FrameStream `frame_gap_timeout_ms` 50 ms — the real
deadline; row expiry deleted, see `wall2-deadline-findings-2026-08-30`)
all sit upstream of the AU ring; D ≈ 12–16 ms never waits on anything
they haven't already resolved. Related follow-up: below ~3.4 Mb/s pair
the 50 ms gap timeout clips the sliding window's reach-back
(`w_useful ≈ gap_timeout · stream_rate / (8·332)`) — a rate-aware
gap_timeout is queued separately.

## The implementation (maburplay `display.regulate_ms`, default 12)

`gs/player/src/frame_regulator.{h,cpp}` + wiring in `main.cpp`. Clock
map anchors on the fastest observed frame (min of `mono − pts64`,
snap-down instant, upward leak 60 ppm ≈ 3× measured drift); mailbox
discipline preserved (newer frame displaces held); late frames present
immediately; pts jump >2 s resets the map. The regulator is a third
holder of MPP buffers, so both `drop_all()` flush points flush it too.
Observability: `regulator:` exit line (held/late/replaced/disconts/
hold_ema) plus `present_jitter` — an |Δ present-interval| EMA printed
even when off, which is the A/B number. 0 = bit-exact old behavior.

**Bench A/B (live link, 90 s per leg, exit-line `present_jitter`):**

| regulate_ms | present_jitter | held / late / replaced |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (off) | 9.68 ms | — |
| **12 (shipped default)** | **2.94 ms (−70%)** | 3920 / 1384 / 5 |
| 16 | 5.32 ms | 5123 / 236 / **804** |

⚠ **The single-slot mailbox caps useful D at ~the burst spacing.** At
D=16 the hold outlives the gap to the next burst-decoded frame often
enough that the regulator's mailbox displaces ~15% of held frames
(`replaced=804`) — each a never-shown frame, i.e. self-inflicted judder
that more than cancels the smoothing. 12 ms sits under that knee
(replaced=5). If a future rung/scene profile wants D≥16, the regulator
needs a 2-deep release queue first, not a bigger number in the config.

Encoder-side class-size equalization (making base/enh payloads
comparable at the source) would shrink the needed D further; parked —
star6e RC size knobs are mostly dead (`airtime-model.md` §3).

## Follow-up shipped: rate-aware `frame_gap_timeout` (same day)

The 50 ms FrameStream wall was clipping the sliding window's reach-back
below ~3.4 Mb/s pair (`w_useful ≈ gap_timeout · stream_rate / (8·332)`)
— repairs still inbound for frames already truncated.
`GapTimeoutPolicy` (`gs/src/gap_timeout_policy.h`) stretches the
per-stream timeout to the window's time-span,
`clamp(w/seq_rate + 15ms, floor, video.frame_gap_timeout_max_ms)`
(default cap 150, 0 = old fixed behavior). `seq_rate` is the per-sid
seq-advance rate from the decoder (send rate, loss-robust, 2 s
half-life EWMA); `w` self-calibrates from the observed repair
`window_len` hwm (the GS config never knew the drone's `fec.window` —
and `sw::kMaxWindow` is 255, the u8 wire ceiling, NOT the window; a
first draft tripped on exactly that). Whole-frame gaps wait
`max(sid timeouts)` since the missing frame's sid is unknowable;
mid-frame gaps and headerless slots use their own sid's. During a fade
the rate decays and the timeout rides the cap — deliberate, the
post-fade repair burst can still heal. Live values exported as
`link.video.gap_ms` [base, enh].

Bench A/B (pinned mcs1, 20% union injected loss, burst 3, 106 s/leg):

| | cap 0 (fixed 50) | cap 150 |
|---|---|---|
| holes/min | 645.9 | **580.8 (−10%)** |
| delivered fps | 49.4 | 50.8 |
| stalls 50–80 / 80–150 / >150 per min | 307 / 56 / 7.9 | 321 / 96 / 7.9 |
| iv p99 / max | 102 / 221 ms | 107 / 219 ms |

~65 holes/min became 80–150 ms stalls, one-for-one — the intended
trade: under rally a hole smears until the refresh repaints, a stall is
a clean hitch. `>150/min` and iv max unchanged — the cap bounds the
worst case. Final judgment is perceptual, on a real flight.
