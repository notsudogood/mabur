# Deploying maburd / maburgs

There is no backward-compatibility obligation in mabur (see CLAUDE.md),
but a deploy still touches two devices and is never atomic. That window,
and the config-load behaviour below, are what actually bite.

The 2026-08-12 constant-TX-power change (`docs/data-provenance.md`)
bumped `RC_VERSION` 1 -> 2, the first bump the protocol has ever had; the
2026-08-15 RCF shrink (dropping the write-only `ack_seq`, `score` and
`layer_delivery` fields, none of which `maburd` ever read) bumped it
2 -> 3. mabur owns the RC wire outright now: the goldens live in
`tests/test_rc.cpp` rather than mirrored from devourer's frozen
`tools/precoder/rc_proto.py` (pinned at version 1, no longer an oracle),
so further bumps are cheap and need no deprecation path — the deploy
window is their entire cost, and that cost is real.
**A drone and GS at different versions reject each other's
frames in BOTH directions**, and because DISC_ACK is what carries
`CAP_FRAME_WIRE`, the symptom is NO VIDEO AT ALL — visually identical to
the stale-caps restart deadlock (below). Restarting either daemon will
not fix a version mismatch; recovery is to finish the deploy. Deploy
order is config-before-binary on both devices: a stale or removed key
makes `maburd`/`maburgs` fail to start (a config-load error exits **1** in
`maburd` and **2** in `maburgs` — both in the `load_config` try/catch in
their respective `main()`; the two daemons do NOT agree, so do not key a
script off either number), and unlike `maburplay`'s
`S97maburplay` — which stops respawning on exit
2 or 143 — neither daemon's wrapper (`S96mabur`, `S96maburgs`,
`maburgs.service` under systemd) checks the exit code at all, so it
crash-loops the daemon forever at the unconditional 2 s respawn delay.
The visible symptom is a repeating `unknown key` line in `/tmp/mabur.log`
/ `/tmp/maburgs.log` every 2 seconds, not a daemon that exits and stays
down. The clean sequence is still: stop both daemons, edit both configs,
swap both binaries (`df` and prune first — the drone rootfs fits max 2
maburd), start both. Rollback, when you actually need one, is PAIRED: an
old binary needs its old config restored alongside it — there is no
forward or backward config compatibility and no attempt at any, so
rolling forward is usually the shorter path. **The repo's install scripts will not do
the config edit for you, and will refuse to run rather than guess:**
`bundle/install.sh` and `gs/bundle/install.sh` scp the binary
(`bundle/install.sh:37`, `gs/bundle/install.sh:32`), then check the
target's config before touching it (`bundle/install.sh:39-54`,
`gs/bundle/install.sh:37-52`) — copy the shipped `.toml` default only if
the device has NEITHER a `.toml` NOR a legacy `.json`; if a `.toml`
already exists, leave it alone ("never clobber a tuned one"); if only a
legacy `.json` exists (a device that has never been converted), **print
an error and exit 1 instead of seeding the repo default over it**, since
a bare "no `.toml`" check can't tell "already converted, nothing to do"
from "never converted, about to lose the tuned config" — and the latter
boots cleanly on repo defaults, with no crash, no signal, and nothing
in the startup defaulted-keys report to catch it (that report compares
against compiled defaults, not the device's old config). Convert the
`.json` to `.toml` by hand first (see "JSON to TOML cutover" below), then
re-run the installer. Once past that check, both scripts start the
service immediately (`bundle/install.sh:57-61`,
`gs/bundle/install.sh:57-61`); neither migrates an existing config, so on
a device that has ever been tuned the four removed keys must also be
deleted from `/etc/mabur.toml` and `/etc/maburgs.toml` BY HAND before the
new binaries start.

**Restarting the drone daemon over ssh: use `setsid`.** `S96mabur`'s respawn
loop is a background subshell of the shell that started it, so a plain
`ssh root@drone '/etc/init.d/S96mabur start'` gives you a `maburd` that dies
with the ssh session — the daemon comes up, ssh returns, and the link drops
seconds later for no visible reason. Detach it:
`setsid /etc/init.d/S96mabur start </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &`. (Measured
during the 2026-08-28 Part A gate; it applies to any wrapper started from a
non-interactive ssh command, not just this one.) The mirror image also happens: on
2026-08-29 an `ssh root@drone '...; /etc/init.d/S96mabur stop; mv ...'`
one-liner died at the `stop` and never ran the rest — the daemons stopped,
the ssh command silently returned, and the swap that was supposed to follow
it had not happened. `S96mabur stop` kills a PID read from
`/var/run/mabur-loop.pid`, and after hours of uptime that PID can name
something else. **Never chain work after a `stop` in the same ssh command:
stop in one invocation, verify with `ps`, then swap in the next.**

## Config format

The three configs are TOML. The parser (`common/src/toml.cpp`) accepts a
deliberate subset and rejects everything else with a `file:line` message
rather than reinterpreting it:

| Accepted | Rejected |
|---|---|
| `# comment`, own line or trailing | inline tables `{ a = 1 }` |
| `[table]`, `[table.sub]` | dotted keys in assignments (`a.b = 1`) |
| `[[array.of.tables]]` | literal `'strings'`, multi-line `"""` |
| `key = "basic string"` (`\\`, `\"`) | dates, hex, underscored ints |
| `key = 149`, `-24`, `1.0` | arrays of arrays, mixed-type arrays |
| `key = [1, 2, 3]`, multi-line, trailing comma | duplicate keys, table redefinition |
| `key = true` / `false` | everything else |

An int loads into a float field (`airtime_budget = 1` is fine); a float
never loads into an int field (`symbol_size = 332.0` fails).

Two ordering rules TOML imposes: top-level scalars must precede the first
`[table]` header, and once `[[link.ladder]]` opens you cannot go back to
adding `[link]` scalars.

At startup each daemon prints the known keys the file did not set, with
the value they fell back to. After hand-editing a config, read that list:
anything unexpected in it is a knob you dropped.

**The bundles set every knob (2026-09-10).** All three shipped defaults —
`bundle/mabur.default.toml`, `gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`,
`gs/player/bundle/maburplay.default.toml` — are the live flight configs off
the drone and the GS, extended so that every key its loader knows is written
out explicitly: live value where the device had one, struct default where it
did not.

The one deliberate divergence from the flown value is
`radio.power_mode`, which ships `"none"` while this drone flies `"offset"`.
`rate_walls_rel` is a per-UNIT calibration (`docs/calibration.md`) and the
shipped file cannot know the wall of the board it lands on, so it carries the
author's 8812EU numbers as a reference and leaves them inert — parsed and
range-checked, never programmed. Measure your own vtx before setting
`"offset"`: ssh to the GS and run `maburcal start`, which sweeps the walls,
writes them to the drone's `/etc/mabur.toml` (backing the old file up to
`.pre-cal`) and flips `power_mode` to `"offset"` itself — no restart, no
laptop-side step. ⚠ `"none"` also skips the `SetTxPowerOffsetQdb(0)` beside
the plan, so a global offset left in the chip by a bench tool survives a
`maburd` restart; power-cycle if you need a known baseline. On a stock bundle the startup defaulted-key list is therefore
**empty**, and anything in it is a real gap. Three tests hold that line
(`bundle_default_sets_every_known_key` in `test_config` and
`test_player_config`, `bundle_default_sets_every_known_key_but_radio_cards`
in `test_gs_config`), so **a new config key must be written into its bundle
in the same commit** or the host suite fails.

The single permitted omission is `radio.cards` on the GS: its *absence* is
the auto-scan setting (a `[[radio.cards]]` list pins exactly that set and
skips the bus probe), so no value can express it. `stats.host`/`stats.port`
are absent for a harder reason — the loader fails boot if either appears
alongside `[[stats.out]]`. Both are commented out in place in the bundle.

**Scripted edits.** `json_cli` no longer applies. Keys sit under `[table]`
headers rather than dotted paths, so a bare
`sed -i 's/^symbol_size.*/symbol_size = 656/'` hits `[fec]` **and**
`[msp]` — the same trap exists for `enable`, `window`, `port` and `host`.
Anchor the range:

    sed -i '/^\[fec\]/,/^\[/ s/^symbol_size[[:space:]]*=.*/symbol_size = 656/' /etc/mabur.toml

The bundles column-align their `=` (`symbol_size     = 332`, 43 of
`bundle/mabur.default.toml`'s 59 keys are padded this way) — a naive
`^symbol_size = ` anchor matches nothing against that padding and sed
still exits 0, so a hand-written replacement must tolerate the padding
the way the anchor above does. Do not "fix" the bundle files' alignment
to make a plain anchor work; it's deliberate and readable — fix the sed
instead, and verify with a `grep` of the target key afterward. Prefer
`vi` for one-off changes.

## JSON to TOML cutover

All three configs moved from JSON to TOML on 2026-09-07. There is
deliberately no converter script: the operator reads each device's old
`.json` and hand-writes the new `.toml` against it, so a tuned value
never survives a mechanical transform that might silently drop or
reshape it.

**Per device, independent, no wire impact.** Config never crosses the
air — it only ever configures the local daemon — so a TOML drone against
a JSON GS is a perfectly fine pair mid-cutover; this is nothing like the
`RC_VERSION` flag days above. What is NOT independent is binary and
config on the SAME device: they swap **together**. An old binary cannot
read `.toml` (it doesn't know the format exists) and a new binary will
not read the old `.json` (parsing is TOML-only, no fallback), so the two
must change in the same window or that one device fails to boot.

1. **Drone.** `df -h /` first — the 5.8 MB rootfs fits at most two
   `maburd` binaries, so prune old `.pre-*` copies before staging a new
   one. Read the live config, hand-write the TOML against it, then swap
   both together:
   ```sh
   ssh root@<drone> 'cat /etc/mabur.json'                 # read the tuned values
   # hand-write /tmp/mabur.toml against that output
   ssh root@<drone> '/etc/init.d/S96mabur stop'
   scp -O /tmp/mabur.toml       root@<drone>:/etc/mabur.toml
   ssh root@<drone> 'mv /usr/bin/maburd /usr/bin/maburd.pre-toml'
   scp -O out/arm/maburd        root@<drone>:/usr/bin/maburd
   ssh root@<drone> '/etc/init.d/S96mabur start'
   ```
2. **GS.** Same shape: read `/etc/maburgs.json`, hand-write
   `/etc/maburgs.toml`, stop `S96maburgs`, swap config and binary
   together (rollback copy `maburgs.pre-toml`), start.
3. **Player.** Same shape again for `maburplay`/`maburplay.json`/
   `maburplay.toml`. There is no `gs/player/bundle/install.sh` to do this
   step for you — copy `out/arm64/maburplay.default.toml` (staged by
   `tools/build-arm64.sh` next to the fonts and splash) to
   `/etc/maburplay.toml` by hand, or hand-write it against the live
   `maburplay.json` the same way as the other two. Do not skip this: with
   no `/etc/maburplay.toml`, `maburplay -c /etc/maburplay.toml` exits 2,
   and `S97maburplay` treats exit 2 as terminal — no respawn, permanently
   black GS screen, not a crash-loop you'd notice in a log tail.
4. **Verify with the defaulted-keys report**, not by eye. Each daemon
   prints `config: N key(s) defaulted:` on boot — that line, read
   immediately after each swap, is the only safety net against a knob
   the hand-conversion dropped. An unexpected name in it means a value
   that should have carried over from the old `.json` fell back to the
   compiled default instead.
5. **Rollback is paired and per device**, same rule as everywhere else in
   this page: restore the old `.json` **and** the `.pre-toml` binary
   together, never one alone — a `.pre-toml` binary started against the
   new `.toml`, or vice versa, just fails to boot again.
6. **Delete the old `.json` files only after a clean flight** on the new
   config, per device.

Two holes in that safety net, worth knowing before you trust it blind:

- The defaulted-keys report checks for whole keys that are absent from
  the file; it says nothing about a key that IS present but short. Drop
  one `[[stats.out]]` entry or one `[[link.ladder]]` rung while
  hand-converting and the report stays silent — the array key was
  supplied, just with fewer elements than before.
- An absent `[[stats.out]]` array does not follow the `(section absent)`
  convention the rest of the report uses — it reports as its scalar
  fallback fields, `stats.host`/`stats.port`, defaulted individually,
  which reads like two ordinary scalar defaults rather than "the whole
  export list is gone."

## Stale-caps restart deadlock — retired

The old failure mode: either daemon restarting (drone reboot, `maburgs`
restart, GS reboot — anything that resets one side's session state while
the other side keeps running) left a rebooted GS stuck at
`peer_caps_ == 0`, refusing video forever (`REFUSING video: peer session
did not advertise CAP_FRAME_WIRE`) because it had no fast path back to
re-learning the live drone's caps, and a rebooted drone likewise had no
way to re-teach a GS that was still nominally LINKED. The only known
recovery was the manual dance: `waybeam stop` on the drone, wait for the
GS log to print `video tail -> frame wire`, then `waybeam start`.

The caps-reteach pair retires this dance for same-version pairs:
- the drone acks a keep-alive DISC while already LINKED, instead of
  ignoring it, so a GS that forgot its caps gets them re-taught without
  needing to re-enter rendezvous;
- the GS sends its keep-alive DISC on a fast cadence
  (`unacked_keepalive_ms`, default-only, no config key) whenever its
  peer's caps are unknown, instead of the slow steady-state
  `beacon_keepalive_ms`, so the re-teach happens in seconds rather than
  however long the next slow beacon would take.

Gate-verified on hardware 2026-08-28: 5x drone `maburd` restart and 5x GS
`maburgs` restart, each under a live peer, all 10 recovered unaided
(`fps` back to ~60, `frame_id_gaps` flat, no `REFUSING`/`chip_caps=0x0000`
in the GS log) within the standard ~25 s post-restart wait — no
`waybeam stop`/`start`, no manual restart of either daemon.

**Both binaries must carry the fix for it to self-heal.** An old-GS +
new-drone pair (or new-GS + old-drone) is *safe* — same `RC_VERSION`, no
crash-loop, no frame rejection — but **un-healed**: the side still
running the old binary lacks its half of the re-teach, so a restart on a
half-deployed pair still needs the manual `waybeam stop` -> wait for
`video tail -> frame wire` -> `waybeam start` dance until the deploy is
finished on both ends. ⚠ Since the 2026-08-29 venc fold-in that
escape hatch no longer exists on the drone at all — there is no `waybeam` to
stop — so the equivalent is `S96mabur stop` / `start`, which restarts the
encoder along with the link. Keeping both ends on the same build is what
makes that never necessary.


## The venc fold-in — what a drone deploy is now (2026-08-29)

`maburd` runs the encoder itself. The SigmaStar MI pipeline (VIF/VPE/ISP/VENC
+ the JPEG channel) is brought up inside the daemon from the `venc` config
section, frames are handed to the FEC path in-process, and the encoder knobs
are direct function calls — no `waybeam` process, no HTTP control plane, no
frame-shm ring between two processes. Consequences for a deploy:

- **The drone binary is a DYNAMIC glibc executable**, not the old static musl
  one (`tools/build-arm.sh` builds it with the OpenIPC Buildroot toolchain;
  `tools/build-arm-glibc.sh` and `cmake/arm-musl.cmake` are gone). NEEDED:
  `libstdc++.so.6` (in `/usr/lib`, not `/lib`), `libm`, `libgcc_s`, `libc`,
  `ld-linux-armhf.so.3` — all present on the OpenIPC rootfs. It is ~950 KB
  stripped, roughly half the musl binary, which is why the rootfs fits the
  rollback rotation at all.
- **`waybeam` must be inert before `maburd` starts.** Two processes cannot
  own the MI pipeline; the loser gets no camera. The flag day therefore stops
  `S95waybeam`, clears its execute bits so it never runs at boot again, and
  moves `/usr/bin/waybeam` to `/usr/bin/waybeam.retired`. ⚠ It must be
  `chmod a-x`, not `chmod -x`: with no class specified, `chmod` applies the
  umask, so under the drone's 0022 umask `chmod -x` clears only the OWNER's
  x bit and leaves `-rw-r-xr-x` — which root can still execute, and which
  BusyBox `rcS`'s `[ -x ]` test still accepts. Hit and fixed during the
  2026-08-29 flag day; verify with
  `[ -x /etc/init.d/S95waybeam ] && echo STILL EXECUTABLE`.
- **The config gains `venc` (pipeline bring-up) and `encoder` (RcAgent's
  bitrate/ROI policy), and loses `waybeam` and `frame_ring_name`.** Strict
  keys mean the old config fails boot against the new binary and vice versa,
  so this is a paired swap like any other. `bundle/mabur.default.toml` carries
  the shipped shape; the bench's tuned values live in `/etc/mabur.toml`.
- **There is no `venc.bitrate` key and never will be.** The encoder rate comes
  only from `RcAgent::run_bitrate_policy()` — see `docs/link-adaptation.md`.
- **The GS deploys with the drone.** The `Telem` struct widened to 70 bytes for
  the venc ring stats, so a mismatched pair drops `T_TELEM` on CRC and the
  sideport's `drone.*` block reads `null` until both ends run the same build.
  Video itself is unaffected by that particular mismatch, but "no drone rows in
  maburtop" after a half-finished deploy is this, not a dead uplink.

### Flag-day sequence (drone)

```sh
ssh root@<drone> 'df -h /; ls -la /usr/bin/waybeam* /usr/bin/maburd*'   # prune first
tools/build-arm.sh                                # -> out/arm/maburd
scp -O out/arm/maburd  root@<drone>:/tmp/maburd.new
scp -O <new-config>    root@<drone>:/tmp/mabur.json.new
ssh root@<drone> '
  /etc/init.d/S95waybeam stop; /etc/init.d/S96mabur stop; sleep 1
  mv /usr/bin/waybeam /usr/bin/waybeam.retired && chmod a-x /etc/init.d/S95waybeam
  mv /usr/bin/maburd /usr/bin/maburd.pre-foldin
  mv /etc/mabur.json /etc/mabur.json.pre-foldin
  mv /tmp/maburd.new /usr/bin/maburd && chmod 755 /usr/bin/maburd
  mv /tmp/mabur.json.new /etc/mabur.json
  reboot'
```

Reboot rather than a restart, deliberately: it is the only thing that proves
the boot order (`S95waybeam` inert, `S96mabur` bringing the camera up from
cold) instead of leaving it to the next unplanned power cycle.

Post-boot gates: `ausniff` ~60 fps / 0 `frame_id_gaps`; `curl 127.0.0.1:8301/venc`
on the drone answers with advancing `frames`; the GS sideport shows the
`drone.*` telemetry rows again; the GS ctl log shows a normal cold climb and
park.

### Rollback — the trio, and the two steps that bite

⚠ **2026-08-29 cleanup: waybeam no longer exists on the drone at all** —
binary (incl. every rollback copy), `/etc/waybeam.json`, and `S95waybeam`
were deleted after the fold-in soaked. Rolling back the fold-in is now a
re-deploy, not a file swap: rebuild waybeam in `../openipc-builder`
(waybeam-venc pkg, pinned f956a52), scp it to `/usr/bin/waybeam`, restore
`/etc/waybeam.json` from the archived copy
(`out/drone-waybeam-config-final-2026-08-29.json` on the dev host), and
recreate `S95waybeam` from the openipc-builder package's `init.d/`. The
same cleanup also removed **every** `maburd.pre-*`/`mabur.json.pre-*`
rollback from the drone and the `*.pre-*` binaries from the GS (archived
on the dev host as `out/drone-rollback-archive-2026-08-29.tar.gz` and
`out/gs-rollback-archive-2026-08-29.tar.gz`) — rollback of anything now
means rebuild-from-git (or unpack the archive) + redeploy, per the
roll-forward policy. After the pieces are back in place, the sequence
below still applies:

```sh
ssh root@<drone> '
  /etc/init.d/S96mabur stop; killall maburd; sleep 1
  mv /usr/bin/maburd /usr/bin/maburd.foldin
  mv /usr/bin/maburd.pre-foldin /usr/bin/maburd
  mv /etc/mabur.json /etc/mabur.json.foldin
  mv /etc/mabur.json.pre-foldin /etc/mabur.json
  chmod 755 /etc/init.d/S95waybeam
  /etc/init.d/S95waybeam start
  # 1. WAIT for waybeam HTTP to answer -- do not sleep a fixed interval
  for i in $(seq 60); do
    wget -q -O - "http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/get?video0.bitrate" && break
    sleep 1
  done
  # 2. re-apply the bitrate AND restart maburd, always as a pair
  wget -q -O - "http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/set?video0.bitrate=3000"
  setsid /etc/init.d/S96mabur start </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &'
```

Both numbered steps are load-bearing, and skipping either reproduces the
waybeam bitrate wedge (`docs/`-recorded 2026-08-28; hit again during the
2026-08-29 bench restore). The failure is loud and looks like a radio problem:
the encoder floods at its last rate into a rung-0 link, the ladder is trapped
at `mcs1`, `txq_drop` climbs into six figures, the GS sees ~48 fps with 1019
`frame_id_gaps`, and the SoC hits 70 °C. Why each step:

1. A `set?video0.bitrate=` issued while waybeam's HTTP server is still
   initialising returns `Connection refused` and is silently lost. Poll until
   it answers.
2. The **pre-fold-in** `maburd`'s RcAgent only pushes a bitrate when its
   computed value CHANGES, so on a parked link it will not re-assert over
   whatever waybeam came up with. The restart forces the stamp on entering
   LINKED. (Current `maburd` also re-asserts every 5 s —
   `RcAgent::kReassertMs`, `docs/link-adaptation.md` — but that is exactly
   the binary this runbook is rolling BACK from, so step 2 stands.)

Restore the GS's `maburgs.pre-foldin` at the same time, for the telemetry
reason above.

## `maburplay` — `display.chain_budget` (2026-09-02)

Additive with an in-code default of 3 (0 = unbounded, the prior behavior),
same rules as the vsync keys below: binary first, key optional. Rolling
back to a pre-2026-09-02 binary (`maburplay.pre-chain` or older) with the
key present in `/etc/maburplay.json` fails strict keys at boot — strip it
first. Range [0, 60]; the bench A/B that sizes it is in
`docs/observability.md` under the regulator line.

## `maburplay` — the vsync-locked regulator (2026-08-31)

The three new player config keys — `display.vsync_lock`,
`display.vsync_lead_ms`, `display.lat_log_dir` (removed 2026-09-06 — see
below) — are **additive, with in-code defaults**. Strict keys only rejects
a key that is UNPRESENT in the binary but PRESENT in the file; it says
nothing about a key that is merely absent from the file, which just takes
the compiled-in default.
So this swap, unlike the RC-version and venc flag days above, needs
**no config edit before the binary swap**: drop in the new `maburplay`
against the existing `/etc/maburplay.json` and it boots with
`vsync_lock: true`, `vsync_lead_ms: 6`, `lat_log_dir: "/media/dvr/log"`
without either key ever having been written to the file.

**Rollback gotcha, the other direction.** Strict keys still cuts the
other way once the file HAS been touched: if `/etc/maburplay.json` picks
up any `display.vsync_*` key or `lat_log_dir` — which the vsync A/B
protocol does, by design, since it toggles `vsync_lock` in the file
between arms (`docs/bench-protocols-latency-2026-08-31.md`) — a
pre-vsync `maburplay.pre-vsync` binary will reject the file at boot and
`S97maburplay` stops respawning on that exit code, same failure shape as
the drone/GS mismatch above but silent (no crash-loop to notice; the
player just doesn't come back). **Strip the `display.vsync_*` /
`lat_log_dir` keys from the file BEFORE dropping back to
`maburplay.pre-vsync`** — config-before-binary applies rolling back too,
not only rolling forward.

## 2026-09-04 RC_VERSION 6 (probe stream)

The discrete s3 probe is replaced by an always-on probe-stream canary
(`docs/link-adaptation.md` "Probe stream"); the RCF head gains a fixed
`probe_profile` byte and `RCF_F_PROBE_ENH`/`CAP_ENH_PROBE`/`CAP_S3_PROBE`
are deleted — RC_VERSION 5 → 6, so this is a version-mismatch flag day
like the 2026-08-12/2026-08-15 bumps above: a mismatched pair rejects
each other's frames in both directions and, since DISC_ACK carries
`CAP_FRAME_WIRE`, looks like no video at all until both ends match.

**GS config first.** `/etc/maburgs.toml` gains the optional `link.probe`
block (live defaults if omitted: `enable true, rung_offset 1, clean_ms
2000, max_util <0 ⇒ down_util, min_syms 40, silence_ms 500, pin_mcs -1`)
and loses five flat keys that now FAIL BOOT — delete them before the
binary swap:

```sh
grep -nE '^[[:space:]]*probe_(ms|settle_ms|max_util|s3_min_syms|s3_silence_ms)[[:space:]]*=' /etc/maburgs.toml
```

`probe_s3_min_syms` has a successor, `link.s3_min_syms` (default 50) —
carry over a non-default value before deleting the old key.

Drone config (`/etc/mabur.toml`) is untouched — there is no drone-side
probe config; the RCF byte is the only switch. Sequence:

1. Edit `/etc/maburgs.toml` on the GS (delete the five keys above; add
   `link.probe` or rely on defaults).
2. Swap `maburgs` AND `tools/maburtop.py` together (the sideport's
   `classes` keys change shape — `s2`/`s3` gone, `probe` added — and an
   old `maburtop` against a new `maburgs` mis-renders the signal panel).
3. Swap `maburd`.

Between steps 2 and 3 the pair is mismatched (RC_VERSION 5 drone vs 6
GS): no control link, no video, exactly the deploy-window symptom this
page opens with. Finish the deploy; do not restart either daemon hoping
to fix it.

Rollback is paired, as always: `maburgs.pre-probe` / `maburd.pre-probe`
with `maburgs.json.pre-probe` (the five flat keys restored, `link.probe`
removed) alongside the GS binary — an old GS binary against a config
carrying `link.probe` fails strict keys at boot just as surely as the
reverse.

## 2026-09-06 debug-log consolidation

The five separate debug files (`ctl-NNNN_<date>.log`, `probe-NNNN_<date>.log`,
`au-NNNN.log`, `flight-NNNN.jsonl`, `lat-NNNN.log`, the last three written by
the standalone `flightrec.py` recorder) collapse into one per-session
directory, `<debug_log.dir>/NNNN/` holding `ctl.log`, `probe.log`, `au.log`,
`flight.jsonl` and `lat.log`, gated by one knob: `debug_log.enable`. This is
**config-before-binary on BOTH ground-station daemons**, not just one — an
unknown key fails boot into the usual 2 s respawn loop (see the top of this
page).

- `/etc/maburgs.toml` loses four keys that now FAIL BOOT — delete them
  before swapping `maburgs`: `link.ctl_log`, `link.ctl_log_dir`,
  `link.ctl_log_period_ms`, `link.rung_stats.rung_log_period_s`. Their
  replacements live under the new `debug_log` block (`enable`, `dir`,
  `ctl_period_ms`, `rung_period_s`) — additive, its own key, not a rename
  in place.
- `/etc/maburplay.toml` loses `display.lat_log_dir` — also now FAIL BOOT.
  maburplay holds no logging config of its own any more: it follows the
  `/tmp/mabur-session` marker maburgs writes and needs no key at all.
- **After both binaries land, delete `/root/flightrec.py` and
  `/etc/init.d/S95flightrec` from the ground station.** A leftover S95
  keeps boot-starting the old recorder, which still binds UDP `:8300` —
  starving `maburtop`, which now binds that port directly — and still
  attaches to the AU ring as a second outside reader, racing maburgs'
  own in-process ring publish for no reason.
- **Half-deployed signature:** a session directory containing every file
  EXCEPT `lat.log` (`ctl.log`, `probe.log`, `au.log`, `flight.jsonl` all
  present) means `maburgs` was updated but `maburplay` was not — the old
  player is still writing (or failing to write) `lat-NNNN.log` the old
  way, or not writing anything if it never had `lat_log_dir` set. Swap
  `maburplay` to close the gap; there is no wire-format risk in doing so
  on its own schedule, since this is config/logging only, not an
  RC_VERSION bump.

## 2026-09-09 GS card auto-scan

`maburgs` discovers its radios itself. With no `[[radio.cards]]` in
`/etc/maburgs.toml` it probes the USB bus at startup and receives on every
supported card it finds, identifying each by chip-id — one device-recipient
vendor read of `SYS_CFG2`, no claim and no reset, so a non-radio device that
shares the Realtek VID is asked one question, STALLs it, and is left alone.
Cards are ordered by physical port (`bus-port.path`, logged at startup as
`cards: card 0 = 0bda:a81a at usb 2-1.1`), so `card 0` in the stats and the
OSD is the same antenna across reboots.

Deploy notes, none of which are wire-format:

- **This is a GS-only change.** No RC_VERSION bump, no drone deploy, no flag
  day. Swap `maburgs` alone.
- **Binary before config, unusually.** The new binary reads an old config
  (explicit `[[radio.cards]]` blocks) exactly as before — the list still
  pins, and skips the probe entirely. So swap the binary, confirm, then
  delete the card blocks.
- **The rollback trap is silent.** An OLD `maburgs` with the NEW card-less
  config does not fail boot: absent `radio.cards` used to mean *one default
  card*, so it comes up receiving on a single radio and looks exactly like a
  dead antenna. Rolling back the binary means restoring
  `/etc/maburgs.toml.pre-autoscan` alongside it — the standing paired-rollback
  rule, with no error message to remind you.
- **An empty bus exits 1** after a 15 s wait rather than running blind; the
  `S96maburgs` wrapper respawns at 2 s, which is also the retry a card that
  enumerates late needs. The 2 s per-card reopen retry is unchanged.
- **`radio.tx_card` is no longer range-checked at config load** under
  auto-scan — the count is hardware, not config. A pin past the cards found
  logs `warning: radio.tx_card N but only M card(s) found; falling back to
  auto-select` and runs on auto, rather than costing the uplink because one
  card did not enumerate.

## 2026-09-10 RC_VERSION 7 (TX-power calibration kit)

Two new frame types, `T_CAL_CMD` and `T_CAL_RESULT`, carry the
`maburcal` calibration protocol between `maburgs` and `maburd`
(`docs/calibration.md`) — `RC_VERSION` 6 → 7, a version-mismatch flag day
like the 2026-08-12/2026-08-15/2026-09-04 bumps above. A mismatched pair
rejects each other's frames in both directions and, since `DISC_ACK`
carries `CAP_FRAME_WIRE`, **looks like no video at all** between the two
swaps — exactly the stale-caps restart deadlock's symptom. Restarting
either daemon will not fix it; finish the deploy.

No config keys move. This is a binary-only flag day on both ends —
deploy `maburd` and `maburgs` together, in either order, and confirm
video before treating the deploy as done. Rollback is the usual paired
one: an old `maburd`/`maburgs` pair (`.pre-cal` binaries, if kept) talks
`RC_VERSION` 6 to itself and needs no config change to go with it, since
none of this bump touches config.

`ausniff` is the standing gate for this change (`tools/bench/ausniff.py`)
— run it once both binaries are up, expecting ~59.8 fps and 0 gaps; a
`frame_id_gap` on the very first post-deploy pass can be a phantom from
the restart itself, so take a second pass before treating it as real.

## 2026-09-13 RC_VERSION 8 (relative TX-power walls)

Calibration indices are signed and relative to the chip's efuse anchor;
`Telem` drops `cal_base_ref_idx` (88 → 87 bytes) — `RC_VERSION` 7 → 8, a
version-mismatch flag day like the ones above (no control link and no
video between the two swaps; finish the deploy, do not restart).

**Config keys move on the drone:** `radio.rate_walls_idx`,
`radio.legacy_wall_idx` and `radio.base_ref_idx` are gone;
`radio.rate_walls_rel` and `radio.legacy_wall_rel` replace them. Old
binary + new config, or new binary + old config, both fail boot into the
2 s respawn loop — swap config and binary together on the drone (stop
`S00mabur`, copy both, start with `setsid`). The GS has no config change.
Rollback is paired: `maburd.pre-relwalls` + `mabur.toml.pre-relwalls`
on the drone with `maburgs.pre-relwalls` on the GS.

## 2026-09-17 RC_VERSION 9 (tier 2 down probe)

The RCF head gains `probe_profile_dn`, a second probe byte naming a rung
BELOW the op to canary (15 → 16 bytes before the CRC), and SBI gains
`kProbeStreamIdDn` (6) for the bodies. `RC_VERSION` 8 → 9, a
version-mismatch flag day like the ones above — no control link and no
video between the two swaps, so finish the deploy rather than restarting
`maburd`.

**No config change on either end**, so this is binary-only: swap `maburgs`
then `maburd` (or the other way; the mismatch window is the same either
way). Rollback is the paired pre-branch binaries, `maburgs.pre-dnprobe` +
`maburd.pre-dnprobe`, with no config to restore alongside them.

**Behaviourally inert on arrival.** The GS never sets the new byte yet —
`VrxController::build_rcf()` leaves it at `kNoProbeProfile`, so the drone
resolves no down-probe slot, `RadioTx` slot 3 stays empty and no sid-6
body is ever built. What the deploy actually buys is the plumbing: the
wire carries the byte, the drone emits on it when asked, and the GS scores
what arrives into its own `ProbeTrack`. The arm logic and the
`rate × (1 − 2L)` objective are a later commit — see
`docs/link-adaptation-v2-proposal.md` §3.

**What to watch after the swap.** `ausniff` (fps, `frame_id_gaps`,
resyncs) must be unchanged: the down probe is off, so any movement is this
commit's plumbing, not the feature. `link.ctl.observed_mcs` should track
`link.ctl.rung.mcs`, and `follow_above_ignored` should stay 0.

## Building the device images

Everything above swaps a BINARY onto a running device. This section is the
other path: rebuilding the images themselves. Two separate builders, one per
end, and they treat mabur's version differently — which is the part that
bites.

Checked 2026-09-17. `docs/bench-validation.md`'s image instructions predate
this and name a stale branch; that paragraph now carries a warning pointing
here.

### Drone — `openipc-builder`

- Repo: `gilankpam/openipc-builder`, branch **`feat/mabur`** (last moved
  2026-09-10). NOT `feat/devourer` (2026-07-11, predates the venc fold-in,
  so its image has no current mabur) and not `feat/waybeam` (dead).
- Target: `ssc338q_fpv_openipc-urllc-aio` (SSC338Q / infinity6e).
- Build:
  ```sh
  cd ../openipc-builder
  printf './builder.sh ssc338q_fpv_openipc-urllc-aio\n' | nix-shell
  ```
  ⚠ **`nix-shell --run "./builder.sh …"` silently builds nothing.** The
  `buildFHSEnv` shell sets `runScript = "bash"`, which overrides `--run`:
  bash starts, finds no tty, and exits 0 having done nothing. Pipe the
  command into `nix-shell` instead. (This is also why the same build works
  interactively and "fails" in a script.)
- Output: `archive/ssc338q_fpv_openipc-urllc-aio/<timestamp>/`.
- **mabur is NOT pinned — it tracks master, and from a DIFFERENT REMOTE.**
  Checked directly on `feat/mabur`, 2026-09-17:
  ```make
  MABUR_SITE        = https://github.com/gilankpam/mabur
  MABUR_BRANCH      = master
  MABUR_VERSION    := $(shell git ls-remote $(MABUR_SITE) refs/heads/$(MABUR_BRANCH) | cut -f1)
  MABUR_SITE_METHOD = git
  ```
  So `MABUR_VERSION` resolves master's HEAD at build time and there is no
  SHA to bump. ⚠ `docs/bench-validation.md`'s "bump `MABUR_VERSION` to the
  new SHA (the recipe fetches the public repo by commit)" describes an
  earlier version of this recipe and is stale.
  **The remote is what matters more:** the image builds from
  `gilankpam/mabur`, which is not necessarily the remote a given checkout
  pushes to (this one's `origin` is `notsudogood/mabur`). Work has to reach
  `gilankpam/mabur` master before any drone image can carry it — pushing a
  branch to another fork, or merging it there, does nothing for the image.
- The same build also produces U-Boot (`build_uboot()`, from the
  `gilankpam/u-boot-sigmastar` fork, branch `mabur-fastboot`) — three files
  in `output/images`, of which `u-boot-<soc>-nor-padded.bin` is the one
  `flashcp` wants. `SKIP_UBOOT=1` turns it off. Flashing U-Boot is a
  separate, riskier operation with its own runbook and a **mandatory serial
  console**: see `docs/boot-time-findings-2026-09-07.md` "Flashing — the
  runbook". A prebuilt copy of just that file is published at
  `gilankpam/openipc-builder` release `latest-master` — note that release is
  **U-Boot only**, not a rootfs image.

### Ground station — `sbc-groundstations`

- Repo: `gilankpam/sbc-groundstations` (fork of `OpenIPC/sbc-groundstations`),
  a Buildroot image builder covering several SBCs: RunCam Wifilink, Emax
  Wyvern-Link, Radxa Zero3, OpenIPC Bonnet, Orange Pi Zero 2W (H618).
- Build:
  ```sh
  ./build.sh                                     # default: runcam_wifilink
  DEFCONFIG=orangepi_zero2w_defconfig ./build.sh # or radxa_zero3_defconfig
  nix-shell --run './build.sh'                   # skips host dep setup
  ```
  (`--run` does work here — this is a plain nix-shell, not the FHS env the
  drone builder uses.)
- Output: `<platform>_sdcard.img` plus `<platform>_boot.scr`.
- Flashing: on the eMMC boards, copy the `.img` and the `.scr` to a FAT32 SD
  card, rename the script to `boot.scr`, and boot the device (there are
  `dd`/RKDevTool routes too). The Orange Pi Zero 2W has no eMMC — write the
  `.img` straight to SD.
- **mabur tracks MASTER, not a pin.** Its `package/mabur/mabur.mk` resolves
  the latest master SHA at build time (with a fallback hash for offline
  builds), and builds with drone/test/linkbench off and the GS player on.
  It installs `maburgs`, `maburplay`, the assets, the Python tools, the
  config defaults and the init scripts. So a GS image self-updates to
  whatever mabur master is — which means work on a branch does NOT reach a
  GS image until it merges, and a reflash mid-branch gets master, not your
  branch.
- **GS config lives on a 64 MB FAT32 `CONFIG` partition**, holding editable
  `maburgs.toml` and `maburplay.toml`. That partition survives being read on
  any machine, so GS config can be edited by mounting the card rather than
  over ssh. ⚠ Unverified from this repo: whether `/etc/maburgs.toml` on a
  running device is that file, a copy of it, or independent of it. Confirm
  before assuming an ssh edit persists across a reflash, or that a card edit
  takes effect without one.

### Which version ends up where

| | drone | GS |
|---|---|---|
| builder | `openipc-builder` (`feat/mabur`) | `sbc-groundstations` |
| mabur remote | `gilankpam/mabur` | `gilankpam/mabur` |
| mabur version | **master HEAD** at build time | **master HEAD** at build time |
| reflash while work is unmerged | master, not your branch | master, not your branch |

Both ends resolve master at build time, so there is no pin on either side
and nothing to bump. That is simpler than it sounds only if you remember the
consequence: **an image build can never carry unmerged work.** Branch work
reaches a device exactly two ways — side-load the binary (the sections above),
or merge to `gilankpam/mabur` master and rebuild.

The trap this replaces is real but differently shaped. After an `RC_VERSION`
bump, the danger is not a stale pin; it is that master moves under you. Two
images built either side of a merge carry different wire versions, and a
side-loaded binary is invisible to both. So after a bump: get the change onto
master, then rebuild BOTH images from the same master, and do not mix a
freshly side-loaded end with a freshly flashed one.
