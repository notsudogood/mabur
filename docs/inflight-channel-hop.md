# In-flight channel hop

Reactive, sub-second migration of the live link off an interfered channel,
built on the boot-time auto channel select (`docs/channel-select.md`).
Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-inflight-channel-hop-design.md`
(gitignored — this page is the durable record, and where the two disagree
this page describes what shipped). Reactive only: a healthy link never
moves, and there is no proactive re-ranking while the link is clean.

Built without hardware, then benched on 2026-09-15: deployed both ends,
four fixes forced by the bench (see Measurements), a co-channel hop
confirmed in 268 ms onset-to-video on two cards and 427 ms on one, with
`ausniff` clean through it. Not flown. `docs/handover-inflight-hop-bench-2026-09-15.md`
covers what is still owed — read it before flying with `hop.enable = true`.

## 1. Wire and hop protocol

`RC_VERSION` 8 → 9 (`common/include/mabur/rc_proto.h`), a flag day like
every prior bump: an old/new pair rejects each other in both directions and
has no video, since `DISC_ACK` carries `CAP_FRAME_WIRE`. See
`docs/deploy.md` for the binary-swap sequence that applies to every
`RC_VERSION` bump.

`Rcf` gains:
- `hop_ch` (u8): the channel the drone must be on. Present in every RCF in
  every state — the standing truth, not an event. 0 means "no order ever
  issued"; the drone ignores `hop_ch == 0`.
- `hop_epoch` (u8): bumped by the GS on every order **and** every
  withdrawal, so a repeated `(hop_ch, hop_epoch)` pair is a no-op.

`Telem` gains `channel` (u8, `RcAgent::channel()` at build) and `hop_epoch`
(u8, echo of the last pair applied) — observability only, nothing waits on
either.

**Drone (`RcAgent`, `drone/src/rc_agent.cpp`).** On an accepted RCF whose
`(hop_epoch, hop_ch)` pair differs from the last one applied — the code
compares the **pair**, not the epoch alone (`r->hop_epoch != hop_epoch_ ||
r->hop_ch != hop_ch_`), matching the spec's "differs from the last pair
applied" over the plan's epoch-only draft — and whose `hop_ch` differs from
the drone's current channel: `Actuator::retune(hop_ch, "hop")` (the same TX-
gate-exclusive, 5 ms-drain, `FastRetune` path every other retune uses,
including TX-power re-application), the move is marked unconfirmed under
the existing `move_confirm_ms` rule, and the drone's stderr line prints
`maburd: retune <a> -> <b> (hop)` — the fourth `reason` value alongside
`disc`/`move_unconfirmed`/`rendezvous`. The retune-deferral during a
calibration sweep applies unchanged. The hop-tracking state (`have_hop_`,
`hop_epoch_`, `hop_ch_`) is reset at all **three** places
`have_last_seq_` is already reset for the same reason (a restarted GS
restarts its epoch numbering from 0, so a latched epoch from an old session
must not swallow the new session's first order): a fresh DISC
(`RcAgent::on_disc`), the move-unconfirmed fallback into RENDEZVOUS, and
FAILSAFE entry.

**GS (`ChannelPlan`, `gs/src/channel_plan.h/.cpp`) — two cards:**
1. `HopController::order()` bumps `epoch_`, sets the standing `hop_ch()`,
   and `VrxController::set_hop()`/`restore_rung()`/`blank_store()` run
   synchronously so **this same tick's** RCF already carries the new pair
   and `ref_rung`'s profile (`gs/src/main.cpp`'s `HopAction::Order` case).
2. `ChannelPlan::hop_order(now, target, lead_card)` sends the non-TX card
   (`lead_card`, whichever the TX selector is not currently using) to the
   target; the TX card stays on the old channel (`ChannelPlan::desired()`
   returns `op_` for every other card while `hopping_`). Every hop, order
   or withdraw, logs an `M` line (`hop_lead`, `hop_follow`, `hop_withdraw`,
   or `hop_one_card` — new `MoveReason` values alongside `commit`/
   `ack_override`/`split_home`/`reunite`).
3. First video AU **genuinely received on the target** by the lead card is
   confirmation: `HopController` emits `Confirm`, `ChannelPlan::
   hop_confirmed()` moves `op_` to the target and the TX card follows
   (`M ... hop_follow`). "Genuinely received on" is
   `RxBody::rx_channel` (`common/include/mabur/node.h`) — the channel the
   producing `RadioFrontend` was known to be tuned to at the instant it
   lifted the frame off the card, stamped there, on the producer thread,
   and carried with the body. It is **not** "where is this card tuned
   now": the core loop drains `BodyQueue` up to a full control tick behind
   the RX threads and `RadioFrontend::retune()` does not flush that queue,
   so bodies received on the OLD channel and still queued when the lead
   card's retune landed were being stamped with the target and confirming
   the hop ~10 ms after the order — before the order's RCF had even left
   the slotter (held to the next end-of-AU, up to ~17 ms) on a link that
   documents 30–50 % RCF uplink loss. The TX card then followed to a
   channel the drone had never been told about, the drone's
   `move_confirm_ms` never armed because it had never moved, and recovery
   was `SplitHome` at 5 s or the drone's own 30 s rendezvous. Because the
   stamp is taken at the source, no amount of queueing downstream can
   change it. `retune()` additionally blanks the stamp to 0 = unknown for
   the duration of the move, so a frame delivered across the retune is
   attributed to neither side of it; 0 never equals a hop target, so it
   simply fails to confirm.
4. No video within `hop.confirm_ms` (500 ms default): `HopController`
   withdraws — epoch bumps again, `hop_ch()` reverts to the old channel,
   the lead card returns, the target is backed off (§5). A drone that had
   already moved sees the withdrawal RCF or times out on its own
   `move_confirm_ms`; both converge on the old channel.

A second `hop_order()` while one is already in flight (a fresh trigger
before the first attempt resolved) does not leave the abandoned lead card
silently snapping back: `ChannelPlan` self-emits a `HopWithdraw` M-line for
the abandoned attempt before starting the new one, so the flight log
carries a trace of every attempt, even one the controller itself
superseded (`ChannelPlan::hop_order`, `gs/src/channel_plan.cpp`).

**One card, as built.** `HopController`'s own state machine models the
spec's "send `hop.one_card_repeats` (5) times on the old channel, then
retune" sequence: `HopAction::Order` fires first (state → `Ordered`), and
only once `rcf_sent_since_order >= hop.one_card_repeats` with still no
video does it emit a second action, `HopAction::OneCardRetune`
(`gs/src/hop_controller.cpp:ordered_tick`, pinned by
`tests/test_hop_controller.cpp`'s `one_card_retunes_after_repeats`).
`ChannelPlan`'s own one-card contract moves every card — the sole radio —
the instant `hop_order()` runs (`hop_lead_ < 0` → the target for every
card; pinned by `tests/test_channel_plan.cpp`'s
`one_card_hop_moves_all_and_confirms_or_withdraws`), so `gs/src/main.cpp`'s
`HopAction::Order` handler **only calls `plan.hop_order()` when
`act.lead_card >= 0`** (i.e. two cards) — for one card it is skipped on
`Order` and deferred to `OneCardRetune`, so the sole radio stays on the
old channel while `vrx.set_hop()`/`restore_rung()`/`blank_store()` still
fire immediately and the RCF starts carrying the order that same tick.
Only once `OneCardRetune` fires — after `one_card_repeats` RCFs have gone
out on the old channel with no video — does `plan.hop_order(now_ms,
act.target, -1)` run and the radio actually move. This matches the
spec's §1 sequence as written.

During a two-card hop the FEC decodes from one card only; the split is
bounded by `hop.confirm_ms`. `ChannelPlan::desired(card)` answers the
per-card channel exactly as it does for the boot-time split, so the main
loop's mechanical per-card retune (`gs/src/main.cpp`, the loop that drives
every `RadioFrontend` toward `plan.desired(i)`) needed no hop-specific
branch.

## 2. Verdict engine (`gs/src/hop_verdict.{h,cpp}`, pure)

`HopVerdict::window()` runs every `hop.window_ms` (150 ms) while the link
is in `SESSION` and the boot scout owns no card (`hop_active()` in
`hop_burst_gate.h`; the engine is reset on the falling edge — run
unconditionally, the boot rendezvous read as `interfered` and the shadow
controller ordered every candidate before the boot pick had committed),
fed straight from a dedicated read block in `gs/src/main.cpp` (OFDM
FA/CCA via `read_energy_scout()`, foreign-frame and CRC-fail deltas from
the aggregator, RSSI/SNR EMAs converted from devourer raw units by
`rssi_raw_to_dbm()`/`snr_raw_to_db()` in `hop_verdict.h` — the first bench
run fed the raw values and `weak` could never trip) — **a card mid-dwell
that window is skipped**
(`VerdictCardIn::valid = false`). Link-level: the s1 (BASE) pre-FEC loss
window and the FEC recovered-symbol delta.

Five independent evidence bits, OR'd together every window
(`gs/src/hop_verdict.h`'s `kEvImpaired/kEvWeak/kEvFading/kEvContended/
kEvRaised`):

| bit | rule | key (default) |
|---|---|---|
| impaired | link pre-FEC loss % > `loss_pct` **or** recovered count > `recovered_x` × its 5 s trailing mean | `hop.verdict.loss_pct` (3.0), `recovered_x` (3.0) |
| weak | best card's RSSI < `weak_rssi_dbm` **and** SNR < `weak_snr_db` | `weak_rssi_dbm` (−78), `weak_snr_db` (12) |
| fading | best card's RSSI more than `fading_drop_db` below its frozen/trailing reference | `fading_drop_db` (6) |
| contended | any card's foreign frames/s > `foreign_pps` | `foreign_pps` (50) |
| raised | any card's FA/s > `fa_pps` | `fa_pps` (100) |

Verdict, evaluated in this order (`HopVerdict::window`,
`gs/src/hop_verdict.cpp:79-82`):

```cpp
if (!impaired) o.v = Verdict::Healthy;
else if (weak) o.v = Verdict::Fade;
else if ((contended || raised) && !fading) o.v = Verdict::Interfered;
else o.v = Verdict::Unknown;
```

`interfered` needs **both** contention/a raised floor **and** the absence
of fading — an impaired, non-weak window that is fading (RSSI dropped off
its reference) but also shows contention or a raised floor classifies
`unknown`, not `interfered`: `weak` is checked first and wins outright if
true, and only among the non-weak windows does `!fading` gate `interfered`
against `unknown`. An edge-of-range but otherwise stable link showing
jammer-like FA/foreign symptoms therefore classifies `fade` (if also
weak) or `unknown` (if fading but not weak) — never `interfered` — and
neither case hops; the ladder owns both. The `weak`-before-`contended`/
`raised` edge case (`weak` true, `fading` false, `contended`/`raised`
true) was found unpinned by a branch-reorder mutation during review and
is now covered by `weak_takes_priority_over_contended_when_not_fading`.
The hop trigger is
`interfered` in `hop.persist` (2 default) of the last 3 windows
(`VerdictOut::trigger`). `fade` and `unknown` never hop in v1 — the ladder
handles both.

**References.** Per card, a 5 s trailing median of RSSI; link-level, the 5 s
trailing mean of the FEC recovered rate; both frozen at the first impaired
window, along with `ref_rung` (the ladder's rung at that instant), so the
interferer cannot raise its own baseline mid-episode. A card with no
trailing history yet at freeze time (out of range, or mid-dwell) keeps its
reference untouched rather than adopting a fabricated 0 dBm — a real RSSI
reading is never exactly 0, so a frozen reference reading back as 0 is
treated as "no reference yet" and the card's own current RSSI is used
instead (`fading` can't fire off a fabricated reference). Both references
thaw after 3 consecutive `healthy` windows, or after a hop's verify window
ends — `HopVerdict::reset()`, which the trailing histories themselves
survive; only the frozen snapshot (and the latched persistence window) is
cleared. The second rule is driven by `HopAction::VerifyPass`
(§5): `gs/src/main.cpp`'s `apply_hop_action()` calls `reset()` there, and
only there. A `verify_fail` or a `withdraw` re-orders rather than ending
the hop, and §5 has the retry **reuse** the pre-onset `ref_rung`. Thawing
on those would not damage the retry's own `Order` — `order()` reads
`restore_rung` off the cached `VerdictOut`, and `apply_hop_action()` runs
`reset()` after `hopc.tick()` has already built the action. The cost lands
one window later: after a thaw, the next impaired window re-freezes
`ref_rung` at the **mid-hop** rung (already demoted, or already restored),
and the pre-onset value §5 wants reused is gone. Like every other
action, `VerifyPass` is suppressed while `hop.enable = false`, which keeps
an observe-only flight's references measuring the channel the link is
actually still on.

Every `VerdictOut` also carries the wall-clock span its counter deltas
were gathered over (`t_start_ms`, `t_ms` — the previous window's timestamp
and this one's). The consumer needs it: `gs/src/main.cpp` recomputes a
verdict only every `hop.window_ms` but feeds `HopController` on every
~10 ms control tick, so a cached `VerdictOut` routinely outlives the
window that produced it. See §5.

## 3. Scout and ranking (in-session)

**As built, this is a separate pure module, not a `ChannelScout` mode.**
`gs/src/inflight_scout.{h,cpp}`'s `InflightScout` is its own class — the
boot-time `ChannelScout`'s scheduler (round-robin over
candidates-then-home, its own quiet/beacon interleave) is not reusable for
a periodic mid-flight dwell, and the project's new-module convention
(pure, ctest-covered, no hardware) applies the same way it did to
`channel_scout`/`channel_plan`.

Two-card GS only: a dedicated thread (`gs/src/main.cpp`'s `scout_loop`)
runs once the boot scout has released every card, gated on
`hop.enable || hop.scout_when_disabled` — **`scout_when_disabled` defaults
`true`**, so the scout dwells and logs even with `hop.enable = false`, to
collect ranking/calibration data for the first (observe-only) flights; set
it `false` to fly with literally no dwells. Every `hop.dwell_period_ms`
(333 ms default):
1. Card = whichever the TX selector is not using this cycle (read once at
   cycle start; the selector defers switching onto a card mid-dwell —
   `dwell_busy`/`dwell_card` — and, since the bench, onto a hop's lead
   card while the hop is in flight: `tx_selection_frozen()` in
   `hop_burst_gate.h`. Unfrozen, the RCF carrying the order moved to the
   target channel within 200 ms of three of the first run's four orders).
2. Wait for the next AU boundary on that card.
3. `InflightScout::dwell()`: `FastRetune(candidate)` → discard read →
   sleep `hop.dwell_observe_ms` (5 ms) → real read (FA/CCA/frame counters)
   → `FastRetune(back)`.
4. A `D` scan.log line with `sess=1` and the four step-timing columns.

`InflightScout::dwell()` checks **both** retunes' results, not just the
first: if the retune to the candidate fails, or the observation completes
but the return retune to `back` itself fails, the card's true position is
uncertain — a stranded scout card means the aircraft is down to one radio
with no diversity — so `dwell()` sets `kFlagRetuneFailed` on the record and
**returns `false` without populating the `HopVisit`**, rather than booking
a visit gathered around an unknown card position. Recovery is not this
module's job: `gs/src/main.cpp`'s mechanical per-card retune loop (driven
off `plan.desired(card)` every tick, resynced from live hardware —
`cur_ch[card] = fe.channel()` — on every drained dwell) is what notices
and pulls a stranded card back. A failed dwell also does not leak a
phantom zero-score `HopVisit` into the ranker — an early bug (a
default-constructed `HopVisit{ch=0}` pushed unconditionally, which would
have ranked channel 0 as artificially best) was caught and fixed before
this shipped.

**The periodic scout thread stays two-card-only.** `gs/src/main.cpp`
gates its start on `n_cards >= 2` ("no point spinning it up on one card"
— a one-card GS has no spare radio to dedicate to it). A one-card GS's
ranking data comes entirely from the freshness burst below instead.

**Freshness burst.** `gs/src/main.cpp`: rather than act on a ranking that
may be up to `hop.rank_max_age_ms` old, every candidate is swept once,
back to back, via `InflightScout::burst()` whenever the controller has
no hop in flight (`HopState::Idle` **or** `HopState::Hold`) and the
verdict's trigger is set — **on both card counts**, matching the spec's
§3 "the only card on a one-card GS since the link is already impaired."
The gate does not require `ht.best` to already hold a value (an earlier
build's gate did, which on a one-card GS is circular: the burst is the
only source of visits, so requiring a ranked candidate before running it
made the ranker permanently empty — fixed to run the sweep unconditionally
whenever hop-free-and-triggered). Two cards are unaffected either way,
since the periodic scout thread already keeps the ranker warm before any
burst runs.

The burst is **rate-limited to at most one per `hop.dwell_period_ms`**
(333 ms default, `gs/src/main.cpp`'s `last_burst_ms`/`burst_due`) — reusing
the scout thread's own duty-cycle knob rather than adding a new key.
Without this, a sustained `Hold` (every candidate backed off, interference
persisting) re-enters `idle_tick` on every ~10 ms control tick with the
trigger still latched true, and nothing else paces it: `cooldown_ms` only
applies after a confirmed hop, and `max_hops_per_min` is only counted
inside `order()`, neither of which a stuck `Hold` ever reaches. Unlimited,
the burst would fire back to back — and because it runs synchronously on
the core thread, each pass also stalls RX processing for its duration, so
a one-card GS's sole radio would be off-air almost continuously exactly
when the link is already in trouble. Runs with `inflight_mu` held for its
duration, keeping the periodic scout thread (when one is running, i.e.
two-card) off the same `InflightScout`/`RadioFrontend` at once.

**Ranking** (`gs/src/hop_ranker.{h,cpp}`, pure). Per candidate, over the
last `hop.rank_visits` (5) visits not older than `hop.rank_max_age_ms`
(10 000 ms): `score = Σ (fa + max(cca − own, 0) + 4·foreign)`. Fewer than
2 fresh visits = unranked, never chosen. Lowest score wins; deterministic
tiebreak is **boot-time pick, then home, then config order** — the spec's
binding text (§3: "ties → boot-time pick, then home"), not the plan's
draft which dropped "then home"; both are ranked-clean by definition on a
tie so the runtime risk either way is negligible, but home is what makes
GS and drone converge rather than diverge, and it is now pinned by
`tie_break_prefers_home_over_config_order`. The **boot-time pick is
published after construction** (`HopRanker::set_boot_pick()`, called from
`gs/src/main.cpp` at the first DiscAck, next to the `K` scan.log pick
line): the boot scan has not resolved when the ranker is built, and
passing the configured home as both `home` and `boot_pick` — as an earlier
build did — collapsed the two-term tiebreak into one and made the first
term dead code. The pick is published only when the scan actually measured
something (some channel reached `min_rounds`); with no boot scan at all,
or a drone that appeared before any channel ranked, `boot_pick` stays 0 —
never a real channel — and ties fall through to home exactly as before.
Candidates =
`radio.scan.candidates` ∪ `{home}`, the same set the boot scout ranks — a
strict superset of what `InflightScout` ever dwells on, so
`HopRanker::add()`'s silent no-op for a channel outside the candidate list
can never actually drop a real visit.

## 4. Ladder interaction: restore the pre-onset rung

- `ref_rung` is snapshotted by `HopVerdict` at the first impaired window
  (§2) and rides the hop-order RCF as `profile`/`fec_overhead_*`.
- **The ladder runs unfrozen during detection** — the spec's explicit
  requirement ("a demote or two, each an IDR" is accepted, not
  suppressed). What gates is narrower than the plan's original brief: only
  `LadderController::blank_store()` (the rung store's residual/util EWMA
  writes) is suspended — s3 demote **decisions** (`s3_live`, the residual
  and util checks) keep running the whole time, so a genuinely-fading enh
  layer can still demote itself before the base layer degrades, exactly as
  the spec intends. A demote taken on mid-hop, one-card evidence is priced
  in by the same spec sentence, and `restore()` overwrites it once the hop
  lands; the per-rung EWMA store stays uncontaminated regardless, because
  it was never written to during the blank.
- **The blank starts at the first `interfered` window**, not at the order,
  from two call sites that compose because
  `LadderController::blank_store()` keeps the LATER of the deadlines it is
  given:
  1. `gs/src/hop_blank.h`'s `hop_store_blank_until()` — pure and
     unit-tested like `hop_burst_gate.h`, called from the verdict block in
     `gs/src/main.cpp` — returns `t_ms + confirm_ms + 150 ms` **once per
     impaired episode**, on the first `interfered` window of it
     (`VerdictOut::first_interfered`).
  2. `HopAction::Order` still calls `vrx.blank_store(now_ms +
     hcfg.confirm_ms + 150.0)`, from the order.

  Previously only (2) existed, so the ~300–450 ms of detection windows
  before the persistence gate tripped an order — including the demotes the
  spec explicitly expects, "a demote or two, each an IDR" — were written
  into the per-rung EWMA store against the interfered channel, which is
  exactly the pollution `blank_store` exists to prevent.

  Three gates on (1), each load-bearing:

  - **`hop.enable`.** Disabled, nothing is ordered and the rung is never
    restored, so there is no hop to protect the store from — and blanking
    anyway would silently change what the observe-only flights record
    versus every pre-branch recording, with nothing in the log marking it
    (`docs/data-provenance.md`). (2) is already dead while disabled, since
    `tick()` zeroes the action; this keeps the two consistent.
  - **`interfered`, not `impaired`.** `VerdictOut::ref_frozen` is keyed on
    `impaired`, and `fade` (impaired ∧ weak) and `unknown` (impaired
    otherwise) are impaired too — so keying the blank on it suspended the
    store's EWMA writes through every fade and every unknown window, while
    this section's last bullet is "`fade`/`unknown`: unchanged ladder
    behaviour". Only interference hops, so only interference blanks.
  - **One edge per frozen episode**, which is what bounds it. The deadline
    is computed once, at onset, and is not re-extended by later
    `interfered` windows — so a jam running for seconds, or one
    alternating `interfered` and `healthy` windows without ever reaching
    the 3 consecutive healthy windows a thaw needs, cannot roll it
    forward. The store resumes `confirm_ms + 150 ms` after onset whether
    or not a hop was ever ordered. Re-arming needs a genuine thaw: 3
    healthy windows, or `HopVerdict::reset()` after a verify window ends.

  Any part of the verify window past `confirm_ms + 150 ms` is still
  outside the blank and updates the store normally.
- On the GS, `HopAction::Order` also calls
  `VrxController::restore_rung(ref_rung, now_ms)` → `LadderController::
  restore()`: rung set directly, probation cleared, probe-before-promote
  skipped, logged as ctl.log event reason `hop_restore`. This fires
  **synchronously at order time**, not at lead-confirm or verify-pass — so
  on a real flight `video → restore` can be negative, and
  `tools/flightreport.py` anchors its restore-match window to the order
  timestamp for exactly this reason (§8, and Known limitations).
- After the blank window, normal store-write rules resume; encoder
  bitrate follows the rung as always.
- `fade`/`unknown` verdicts: unchanged ladder behaviour — no restore, no
  blank, the ladder alone decides.

## 5. Verify, roll back, rate limits

`HopController` (`gs/src/hop_controller.{h,cpp}`, pure) owns all of this;
`gs/src/main.cpp` only translates its `HopAction`s into `ChannelPlan`/
`VrxController`/scan.log calls.

- **Verify window** `hop.verify_ms` (1000 ms) after confirmation:
  - `healthy`/`fade`/`unknown` throughout → stands (only a raw
    `Verdict::Interfered` window inside `verifying_tick` breaks it early);
    `verify_pass` logged, the landed channel's backoff cleared, `hops_++`,
    and a `HopAction::VerifyPass` emitted for the caller to thaw the
    verdict references with (§2).
  - **Only a verdict measured entirely after the hop landed can fail the
    verify.** `verifying_tick` compares `VerdictOut::t_start_ms` against
    its own `verify_start_` and ignores anything older. Without this the
    machine failed the verify of a perfectly good channel ~10 ms after
    landing on it: `gs/src/main.cpp` recomputes a verdict every
    `hop.window_ms` (150 ms) but ticks the controller every ~10 ms, so the
    cached `VerdictOut` immediately after a `Confirm` is always the one
    measured before or during the hop, on the old channel — `interfered`
    by construction, since that is why we hopped. It backed the
    just-landed channel off for 30 s, ordered the next candidate, and
    repeated: four orders in ~0.5 s, then `hold_cap`, with the backoff
    doubling 30 → 60 → 120 s, so after two interference events the feature
    had disabled itself for minutes having blacklisted the good channels.
    `t_start_ms` rather than `t_ms` because a window that merely *ends*
    after the confirm gathered most of its deltas on the old channel. The
    cost is one window of detection latency; the first eligible window
    lands ~2 × `window_ms` after the confirm, leaving five inside a
    1000 ms verify.
  - `interfered` inside the window → the target is backed off
    `hop.backoff_ms` (30 000 ms, **doubling per repeat, capped at
    300 000 ms**), and the controller hops again to the next-ranked
    candidate (excluding anything currently backed off) with no new
    detection delay — `ref_rung` from the triggering verdict is reused, not
    re-snapshotted.
  - No video within `hop.confirm_ms` while `Ordered` → withdrawal (§1),
    same backoff.
- **Exhaustion.** All candidates backed off or unranked: home if not
  already there; else `hold` (`hold_exhausted`, no retune — the ladder
  copes). Automatically retried once a shorter backoff expires and a new
  trigger fires (there is no timer of its own; the next `interfered`
  window re-evaluates `ranker.best()`).
- **A hold is a state, and only its EDGES are logged and counted.**
  `idle_tick()` runs from `Hold` as well as `Idle`, so a held controller
  with the trigger still latched re-enters the hold branch on every ~10 ms
  control tick. Logging per tick pushed an `H` line into `scan.log` **and**
  a line to stderr at ~100 Hz (~10 KB/s each) and turned `hop.holds` on
  the sideport into a meaningless six-digit ramp — worst on exactly the
  observe-only (`hop.enable = false`) flight this branch exists to produce
  data from, where the shadow FSM runs the same loop and fills the log
  with `would_hold_cap`. As built: entering logs one event naming the
  reason (`hold_cap`, `hold_exhausted`, or `verify_fail`) and bumps
  `holds()` once; re-entering while already held logs nothing; leaving
  logs one `hold_end` whose `elapsed_ms` is how long the episode lasted.
  `hop.holds` therefore counts hold **episodes**. A hold also now ends
  when the trigger clears — every other way out runs through `order()`,
  which needs a live trigger, so without that exit `hop.state` read
  `hold` for the rest of the flight after a single exhausted episode and
  no `hold_end` ever closed it.
- **Rate limits.** `hop.max_hops_per_min` (4) **includes verify-fail
  retries** — only `hop.cooldown_ms` (2000 ms, between a confirmed hop and
  the next fresh trigger) exempts them. This is a deliberate reading of
  the spec's own sentence structure ("including retries, then hold" vs.
  "verify-window retries exempt" applying only to the cooldown clause,
  not the cap) — the original implementation generalised the cooldown
  exemption to the cap too, letting a genuinely bad link retry unbounded
  (8 orders in under a second against a cap of 4, in one review probe);
  fixed and pinned by `verify_fail_retries_count_against_rate_cap`. Hitting
  the cap mid-verify-retry logs `hold_cap` and does not self-perpetuate —
  the 60 s trailing window (`hop_times_`) slides and the next trigger
  after it clears retries normally.
- **Kill switch.** `hop.enable = false`: the whole state machine still
  runs — verdict windows, the ranker, `HopController`'s ticks, scan.log —
  but `HopController::tick()`'s last statement forces
  `out = HopAction{}` (`None`) whenever `!cfg_.enable`, so nothing is ever
  actually ordered; every event that would have fired logs with a
  `would_` prefix (`would_order`, `would_withdraw`, …) instead. Bundle
  default for the first flights.
- **Convergence.** The drone obeys only the newest `(hop_epoch, hop_ch)`
  pair and homes on `move_confirm_ms`; the GS waits only for video and
  withdraws on `confirm_ms`; the boot-time rendezvous machinery is
  untouched. Worst-case disagreement window is bounded by
  `move_confirm_ms + split_after_ms`, same as at boot.

## 6. devourer (Jaguar3)

`GetRxEnergyScout()` (OFDM FA + CCA, delta-on-read like `GetRxEnergy`) and
a batched-control-transfer path (precedent: the InitWrite async write
queue) landed on `../devourer` ahead of this plan and are consumed
unmodified — no devourer change was part of this task's scope. The
spike's "~10 ms with the batched path, 26 ms without" planning figures are
in the design spec; the measured figure from the real GS path is one of
the numbers `docs/handover-inflight-hop-bench-2026-09-15.md` still owes.

## 7. Config

`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`, `[hop]`/`[hop.verdict]` (drone config
unchanged — the drone has no hop config of its own, it just obeys
whatever `hop_ch`/`hop_epoch` arrive on the RCF):

```toml
[hop]
enable               = false   # first flights observe-only
scout_when_disabled  = true
window_ms            = 150
persist              = 2
dwell_observe_ms     = 5
dwell_period_ms      = 333
rank_visits          = 5
rank_max_age_ms      = 10000
confirm_ms           = 500
verify_ms            = 1000
cooldown_ms          = 2000
max_hops_per_min     = 4
backoff_ms           = 30000
one_card_repeats     = 5

[hop.verdict]
loss_pct             = 3.0
recovered_x          = 3.0
weak_rssi_dbm        = -78
weak_snr_db          = 12
fading_drop_db       = 6
foreign_pps          = 50
fa_pps               = 100
```

Validation (`gs/src/config.cpp`), same fail-fast style as `radio.scan` —
unknown keys fail boot:

| key | range |
|---|---|
| `window_ms` | 50–2000 |
| `persist` | 1–3 |
| `dwell_observe_ms` | 1–250 |
| `dwell_period_ms` | 20–60000 |
| `rank_visits` | 1–100 |
| `rank_max_age_ms` | 1000–600000 |
| `confirm_ms` | 100–5000 |
| `verify_ms` | 200–10000 |
| `cooldown_ms` | 0–60000 |
| `max_hops_per_min` | 1–60 |
| `backoff_ms` | 1000–600000 |
| `one_card_repeats` | 1–50 |
| `hop.verdict.loss_pct` | 0.1–100.0 |
| `hop.verdict.recovered_x` | 1.0–100.0 |
| `hop.verdict.weak_rssi_dbm` | −110 – −20 |
| `hop.verdict.weak_snr_db` | 0–40 |
| `hop.verdict.fading_drop_db` | 1–40 |
| `hop.verdict.foreign_pps` | 1–100000 |
| `hop.verdict.fa_pps` | 1–100000 |

`[hop]`/`[hop.verdict]` are wholly new sections with defaults for every
key, so an old config without them boots unchanged on the new binary
(`enable` defaults `false`) — but `RC_VERSION` still forces the binary
flag day described in §1, since the RCF/Telem shapes changed regardless of
config.

## 8. Observability

**`scan.log`, marker `scanlog 2`** (`gs/src/scan_log.h/.cpp`; formats
locked by `tests/test_scan_log.cpp`). The `A` (1 Hz in-flight energy)
record and `radio.scan.energy_period_ms` are **gone** — the verdict
engine's window reads replace them, feeding `cards[i].energy` on the
sideport continuously in-session instead of once a second (§below). Two
new record kinds:

```
V <t> <verdict> <evidence_hex> <ref_rung|-> <link_loss_pct> <recovered>
  [<card> <foreign> <fa> <cca> <crc> <rssi> <snr> <drssi>]... # a verdict window
H <t> <kind> <epoch> <target> <score> <elapsed_ms>            # a hop event
```

- **V** — one per `HopVerdict::window()` call **that changed the verdict
  or was non-healthy** (not every 150 ms window unconditionally). Per-card
  block order is `foreign fa cca crc rssi snr drssi` (task review caught
  and fixed a fixture/golden mismatch here before shipping — the wire
  order is authoritative). `drssi` is the **link-level** `d_rssi_db`
  (best-card RSSI minus its reference), repeated identically in every
  card's chunk, not a genuinely per-card value.
- **H** — one per `HopController` state transition or logged decision.
  `kind` is always a single snake_case token — `order`, `lead_confirm`,
  `one_card_retune`, `verify_pass`, `verify_fail`, `withdraw`, `hold_cap`,
  `hold_exhausted`, `hold_end` (the hold pair used to be the two-word C++ strings
  `"hold cap"`/`"hold exhausted"`, a space-delimited field containing the
  delimiter — fixed at the emitter rather than kept as a parser
  workaround, since scan.log is designed to outlive the code that wrote
  it). `hop.enable = false` prefixes every kind with `would_` — the
  machine still logs its decisions, it just never acts on them. Note:
  there is no `trail_follow` H-kind — the trailing card following the lead
  is an `M` line (`hop_follow`), not an `H` line; the spec's sketch listed
  it as an H event. `hold_end` closes a hold episode opened by
  `hold_cap`/`hold_exhausted`/`verify_fail`, and its `elapsed_ms` is the
  episode's duration (§5). `tools/flightreport.py` treats it as a
  **terminal** kind, defensively: the controller does not currently emit a
  `hold_end` while a hop-attempt row is open (a hold entry closes the row
  first, and `verifying_tick`'s terminal `verify_fail` carries an
  *unbumped* epoch, so `build_hop_rows`' epoch-match branch reads it as
  the outcome rather than as a retry), but an unrecognised kind arriving
  with a row open falls through to `unterminated` — "the log ends
  mid-attempt" — which would misreport a flight that in fact ended in a
  hold.
- **D** — extended, not replaced: the existing boot-scout dwell line gains
  a trailing `<sess> <to_us> <read_us> <back_us>` (in-session flag + the
  three step timings). Boot-time dwells still emit valid lines with these
  four fields at their defaults (`0 0 0 0`).

Full boot-time record formats (`C`/`K`/`M`) are unchanged and still
documented in `docs/channel-select.md`.

**ctl.log:** new event reason `hop_restore` (§4).

**Sideport** (`gs/src/stats_exporter.{h,cpp}`). New top-level `hop` object,
straight from `HopController`'s own accessors plus the latest
`HopVerdict::window()` output, unconditional (a disabled feature still
exports `enable: false` and idle defaults, matching the existing
`link.probe` pattern):

```
hop: {
  enable, verdict, evidence, ref_rung (null while unfrozen),
  epoch, state (idle|ordered|verifying|hold),
  target (null before the first-ever order), hops,
  holds (hold EPISODES entered, not ticks held — §5),
  last_ms (elapsed_ms of the most recent HopEvent, null until one fires)
}
```

Per-card `cards[i].dwell` (null until that card has completed at least one
dwell): `{visits, score, cost_us}` — `visits` is cumulative over every
completed dwell (success or failure), `score`/`cost_us` are the **last**
successful dwell's, not an aggregate (a failed retune produces no
`HopVisit` to score, so a stale score is kept rather than zeroed).
`cards[i].energy` is unchanged in shape but now refilled every ~150 ms
verdict window instead of once a second from the deleted A-record poll —
noisier tick-to-tick, but it never goes stale for up to a second the way
the old poll could.

**`tools/maburtop.py`:** the header line gains `hop <state>/<verdict>`
next to the existing `scan <state>:<rounds>`; the per-card `busy` column
(`(cca − min(cca,own)) + fa + foreign`, the same score the ranker uses)
now tracks `cards[i].energy` at verdict-window cadence rather than the old
1 Hz poll.

**Player OSD:** the compact bar's `ch:` field appends `(h)` while a hop's
target is the live channel and that target is not home
(`GsSnapshot::hopped`, `gs/player/src/gs_snapshot.cpp`) — **not**
`hop.hops > 0`, which is a monotonic counter that never resets on
withdrawal or on hopping back home and would stay lit forever after the
first confirmed hop. `(h)` and the boot-scan's `(a)` share one suffix slot
(worst_case() reserves exactly `(a)`'s width) with `(h)` taking priority,
since a mid-flight hop is the more actionable of the two for the pilot.

**`tools/flightreport.py` HOP section** (`print_hop_report`,
`load_scanlog`). Session-mode only (`scan.log` is a sibling of `ctl.log`
in the debug-log session directory; there is no legacy filename
heuristic), and skipped entirely on a `scanlog` version below 2 — the
highest marker in the file, since a GS restart rejoins the session
directory and the first `scan.log` after a deploy starts under the old
binary's header. One row
per hop **attempt** — every event that places a fresh `HopAction::Order`
(`order` and retry-triggering `verify_fail`), matched against ctl.log's
`hop_restore` E-lines by nearest timestamp within a 5 s window anchored on
the attempt's own order/retry time (not lead-confirm, per §4's
synchronous-restore finding):

```
t=<order_ts> target=<ch> [SHADOW]  onset->order <ms>  order->video <ms>  video->restore <ms>  outcome <kind>
```

With `hop.enable = false` every row is `would_`-prefixed and printed as
"SHADOW hop(s)" in a separate table rather than being silently folded into
"zero hops" — video never confirms while disabled, so a shadow row's
outcome is structurally almost always a `would_withdraw` timeout, which is
expected, not a bug. On a session with **zero real hops** (the expected
shape of every observe-only flight), the report instead prints:

- the verdict histogram (`healthy`/`fade`/`interfered`/`unknown` counts),
- an evidence-bit tally (`impaired`/`weak`/`fading`/`contended`/`raised`,
  counted over **all** windows, since a window can carry a bit without
  that bit driving the top-level verdict),
- per-card medians (not means — these are counter deltas with outliers)
  of `foreign`/`fa`/`rssi_dbm`/`snr_db` over non-healthy windows —

this is the whole point of the first, `hop.enable = false` flights: the
spec's own Open Items call them "the calibration" for five threshold
defaults that are spike numbers, not measurements, and a verdict name
alone cannot say whether `foreign_pps` or `weak_rssi_dbm` was the one
that nearly tripped.

Also printed: a per-card dwell-cost summary (count and
median(`to_us+read_us+back_us`) for dwells with `sess == 1`, i.e. dwells
that actually cost airtime inside a live session — the free off-session
boot-scan dwells are excluded).

## Measurements

Bench, 2026-09-15 (`docs/handover-inflight-hop-bench-2026-09-15.md` has
the run-by-run record). Two RTL8822EU cards on the GS, the drone on the
bench, interferer = `tools/bench/benchjam.sh` (a spare 8822EU on the host,
QoS-Data 1000 B at 6 Mbit/s, 250 frames/s, ~35 % airtime, `DEVOURER_TX_SA`
set to a non-canonical address so the GS counts it as `foreign`). The
three code fixes the bench forced (verdict units, session gating, TX-card
freeze — commits `dfe09ad`, `fd1b8d5`, `17b7764`) were in place for every
row below except where the row says otherwise. Not run: the non-802.11
(O4) interferer and the fade row (both need hardware the bench did not
have), and no flight yet.

**Dwell cost** (`D` lines with `sess 1`; `to_us` = FastRetune to the
candidate, `read_us` = the real counter read, `back_us` = FastRetune back;
the discard read between retune and observe is not logged separately and
costs about what `read_us` does):

| step | planning figure | measured (median, two cards, 333 ms period) |
|---|---|---|
| retune to candidate (`to_us`) | 4 ms | 2.9–3.2 ms (max 19 ms) |
| discard read | 6.5 ms | ~0.9 ms (not logged; same call as `read_us`) |
| observe (`dwell_observe_ms`) | 5 ms | 5 ms |
| real read (`read_us`) | 6.8 ms | 0.8–1.0 ms (max 19 ms) |
| retune back (`back_us`) | 4 ms | 2.3–2.4 ms (max 5 ms) |
| **total** | **26 ms** (target ~10 ms) | **~12 ms** (`to+read+back` median 6.2–6.5 ms first run, 5.3–5.4 ms over the whole day per `flightreport`; p90 7.7 ms, max 31 ms) |

A candidate that IS the current op channel (the boot pick is always one
of `radio.scan.candidates`) costs nothing to "retune" to (`to_us` 4 us,
`back_us` 2 us) but still spends the 5 ms observe on-channel; a third of
the periodic dwells are that today.

**Bench condition matrix:**

| condition | onset→video (H lines) | rung restored (ctl.log) | ausniff fps/gaps with dwells on |
|---|---|---|---|
| co-channel 802.11 neighbour, 333 ms dwell, two cards | first `V interfered` → `H order` **150 ms**, `lead_confirm` **+118 ms** (onset→video **268 ms**), `verify_pass` +1001 ms; drone followed 165→120 and stayed | `E hop_restore 5 5` at the order (no demote had happened in the 150 ms detection) | 59.6 fps, 0 frame_id gaps, 0 incomplete over 100 s spanning onset, hop and verify |
| same, one-card GS (`[[radio.cards]]` pinned) | `H order` 153 ms, `one_card_retune` +258 ms (5 RCFs at `feedback_ms` 50), `lead_confirm` +274 ms (onset→video **427 ms**), `verify_pass` +1002 ms; drone followed 165→136 | `hop_restore 5 5` at the order, then a **4-rung demote cascade** in the 750 ms after the retune (`residual` 0.88, `util` 1.15–1.48: the drone retunes on the first RCF it hears, the sole GS radio only after all five, so the ladder's loss windows see ~200 ms of 100 % loss), re-promoted to rung 5 over the next 15 s | 59.5 fps, 10 frame_id gaps, 1 incomplete over 85 s |
| non-802.11 (O4/analog) interferer | not run | not run | not run |
| fade (no hop expected) | not run | n/a | not run |
| jammer on a candidate only (149 jammed, link on 120) | **no hop**: zero `H` lines, `hop.target` never left 120 | n/a | 59.7 fps, 0 gaps over 85 s |
| dwell period 100 ms (regression check) | n/a | n/a | 59.5 fps, 0 gaps; 11.5 dwells/s; step medians unchanged (6.4 ms) |
| RCF `rx_pps` with dwells on vs off | median 17.5 (dwells on, n=84 samples) vs 18.4 (old binary, no dwells, n=1762); p10 16.5 both | n/a | n/a |

The candidate-jam row is a weaker exclusion than the table reads: a 5 ms
observe catches about one frame of a 250 frame/s jammer, so 149's dwell
score rose from a median of 0 (mean 0.8) to a median of 6 (mean 6.7, max
25) — and 165's rose to 6 as well from near-field leakage. Enough to rank
it below a clean channel, not enough to call it interfered. The same
blindness cuts the other way: the channel the link just left scores ~6
too, so after a `verify_fail` on the target the ranker can pick the
jammed origin channel straight back (seen in the first run; the origin is
not backed off on hop-away). See Known limitations.

**Verdict at rest** (calibration input for `[hop.verdict]`): on the clean
bench link at rung 5, 65 % of windows carry the `impaired` bit and
classify `unknown` — pre-FEC loss never exceeded 2.5 % (threshold 3 %),
but `recovered > recovered_x (3.0) × its 5 s trailing mean` trips on any
single lost aggregate, because the trailing mean is ~4.6 symbols/window
(p50 2) and one lost aggregate recovers 10–26. Consequences: `ref_rung` is
frozen almost continuously (the thaw needs 3 consecutive `healthy`
windows, ~4 % likely at that rate), so the "pre-onset rung" a real hop
restores can be many seconds stale; nothing hops on it, since `unknown`
never triggers. A floor on the recovered term (an absolute count, or a
fraction of expected symbols) is the obvious retune; left to the
observe-only flights per the spec's open items.

## Known limitations

Found on the 2026-09-15 bench (the handover page has the traces):

- **A withdrawn two-card order strands the drone.** The drone retunes on
  the first RCF carrying the order; if the GS withdraws (no video on the
  target within `confirm_ms`), the withdrawal rides RCFs on the OLD
  channel, which the drone — now on the target — cannot hear. It sits
  there for `move_confirm_ms` (2 s), homes, and rendezvous back, and every
  order the GS places meanwhile is sent to a drone that is not listening.
  In the first run that burned the whole `max_hops_per_min` (4) inside
  2 s and the controller held for 36 s under active interference. The
  TX-card freeze (`tx_selection_frozen`) removed the cause of those
  withdrawals; the strand-then-re-order pattern itself is unchanged and
  will recur on any genuine withdrawal. A guard that refuses a new order
  until the drone has been heard again (video, or its Telem `channel`
  echo) is the candidate fix.
- **The origin channel is never backed off.** Only withdrawn/failed
  targets are. With a 5 ms observe scoring a 250 frame/s jammer at ~6,
  the jammed channel stays "ranked clean" and is a legal next hop after a
  `verify_fail` on the target (first run: 165 → 149 `verify_fail` → back
  to 165 → `hold_cap`).
- **`fa_pps` 100 is marginal on a busy candidate.** 149 (boot-scan busy
  109–306 on this bench) read FA 70–133/s on both cards after the follow,
  which is what failed that verify. Calibration, not code.
- **One-card hops cost the ladder four rungs** (matrix table): the
  five-RCF order window leaves the drone ahead of the GS by ~200 ms, the
  loss windows are not blanked, and the cascade lands after the confirm.
  `blank_store` covers the rung store only; the demote decisions are the
  knob if this matters in flight.

Carried over from the implementation session:

- **A one-card GS needs two freshness-burst passes before it can hop to
  a real candidate.** `HopRanker` requires at least 2 fresh visits before
  a channel counts as ranked (§3), and on one card the burst — rate-limited
  to one pass per `hop.dwell_period_ms` (§3) — is the only source of
  visits. So the first trigger's burst (which fires immediately) leaves
  every candidate still unranked, `hopc`'s `best` stays `nullopt`, and the
  controller orders home (or holds, if already home); only the *second*
  burst, one `dwell_period_ms` later, gives the ranker enough visits to
  name a candidate. Derived (not measured — no hardware this session)
  figures for the shipped defaults, named by milestone since the two
  differ by a full second: **~633 ms** to the order decision (300 ms
  detection + one 333 ms wait for burst 2); **~883 ms** to the physical
  retune (+ `one_card_repeats` (5) × the RCF period — 250 ms, **not**
  500 ms: the RCF period is `link.feedback_ms`, whose shipped bundle
  default (`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`, 50 ms) overrides the
  struct default in `gs/src/config.h` (100 ms) — computing from the
  header alone gives the wrong, too-pessimistic answer); **~0.9–1.1 s**
  to `Confirm` (video lands on the target, `HopState::Verifying`) — the
  milestone the spec's "under one second" goal is about, since that is
  when video is restored; **~1.9–2.1 s** to `verify_pass` (a further
  `hop.verify_ms`, 1000 ms, before the hop is declared to have stood).
  **These figures are best/typical-case and provisional**: derived from
  config defaults and code paths only, assuming interference present
  continuously from t=0 and phase-aligned onset (no wait for the next
  verdict window or RCF slot); real jitter adds up to ~150 ms
  (verdict-window phase, `hop.window_ms`) and ~50 ms (RCF-cadence phase)
  at the tails, and none of it is measured — pending independent
  re-derivation and, eventually, a bench run. Two-card GSes are
  unaffected — the periodic scout thread keeps the ranker continuously
  warm, so a two-card burst typically finds already-ranked candidates on
  its first pass.
- **A one-card freshness burst takes the sole radio off-air for ~30 ms
  per sweep** (three default candidates, a few ms each). Reconciled the
  same tick: `InflightScout::dwell()`'s own return-to-`back` retune, then
  a `cur_ch` resync from live `fe.channel()`, then (if either failed) the
  ordinary mechanical per-card retune loop — all before the tick ends, not
  deferred to the next one.
- **`dwell_busy`/`dwell_card`'s publish is not atomic** with the
  cross-thread read that gates the mechanical retune loop, the verdict
  window, and the TX selector against a card the scout has mid-dwell
  (`gs/src/main.cpp`). A reader can observe `dwell_busy == false` a few
  instructions before the scout thread flips it and calls `retune()`.
  Deliberately left unfixed: closing it means a lock in the hot per-tick
  path at three call sites, for a nanosecond-scale window whose worst case
  (one mistimed dwell) self-heals within the next tick via
  `plan.desired()`'s own retune loop and the `cur_ch` resync.
- **Burst dwells are invisible to the per-card sideport counters.** The
  pre-order freshness burst (§3) calls `InflightScout::burst()` directly
  and does not feed `dwell_recs`/`dwell_visits`, the vectors that populate
  `cards[i].dwell`. Reading `cards[i].dwell.visits` therefore undercounts
  real scouting activity — the periodic scout's dwells are all there, a
  freshness burst's are not.
- **`RxBody::rx_channel` still has a residual mis-stamp window** of
  however far the USB RX pipeline lags real-time beyond `FastRetune`'s own
  duration (~4 ms of control transfers on this path). `retune()` blanks
  the stamp to 0 before the move and sets the new channel after it, so a
  frame delivered at any point during those ~4 ms is correctly "unknown";
  a frame received on the old channel but not delivered to `on_packet()`
  until after the retune completed would still read as the new channel.
  devourer exposes no RX flush to close it outright. This is a
  microseconds-to-low-milliseconds window against the ~10 ms-plus, every
  single hop, by-construction one it replaces.
- **The 5 s `flightreport.py` `hop_restore` match window is an
  uncalibrated judgement call**, chosen with no flight data to check it
  against. It fails safe: an unmatched restore line prints "not found"
  rather than mis-pairing with the wrong hop attempt.
- **`V` line's `drssi` field is link-level, not per-card**, repeated
  identically across every card's chunk on that line — see §8.
- **`scout_when_disabled` defaults `true`.** The first (`hop.enable =
  false`) flights still pay the scout's retune cost on the spare card
  every `dwell_period_ms`, by design (it is what makes the observe-only
  flights a calibration instrument) — but it means the very first flight
  after this deploy already has dwells happening on air, not a
  fully-inert kill switch.
