# In-flight channel hop

Reactive, sub-second migration of the live link off an interfered channel,
built on the boot-time auto channel select (`docs/channel-select.md`).
Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-inflight-channel-hop-design.md`
(gitignored — this page is the durable record, and where the two disagree
this page describes what shipped). Reactive only: a healthy link never
moves, and there is no proactive re-ranking while the link is clean.

**Where the code lives (2026-10-04).** The GS-side hop decision and command
flow is wired inside `gs/src/channel_core.{h,cpp}` (see `docs/channel-select.md`
"Where the code lives" for the full integration). Test the hop inject seam
in `tests/test_channel_core.cpp` (`two_card_order_rcf_carries_hop_and_plan_leads_then_follows`,
`one_card_order_rides_repeats_then_retunes`).

Built without hardware, then benched on 2026-09-15: deployed both ends,
four fixes forced by the bench (see Measurements), a co-channel hop
confirmed in 268 ms onset-to-video on two cards and 427 ms on one, with
`ausniff` clean through it. Not flown. `docs/handover-inflight-hop-bench-2026-09-15.md`
covers what is still owed — read it before flying auto.

## 1. Wire and hop protocol

`RC_VERSION` 8 → 9 (`common/include/mabur/rc_proto.h`), a flag day like
every prior bump: an old/new pair rejects each other in both directions and
has no video, since `DISC_ACK` carries `CAP_FRAME_WIRE`. See
`docs/deploy.md` for the binary-swap sequence that applies to every
`RC_VERSION` bump.

`Rcf` gains:
- `hop_ch` (u8): the channel the drone must be on. Present in every RCF in
  every state — the standing truth, not an event. 0 means "no order ever
  issued"; the drone ignores `hop_ch == 0`.
- `hop_epoch` (u8): bumped by the GS on every order **and** every
  withdrawal, so a repeated `(hop_ch, hop_epoch)` pair is a no-op.

`Telem` gained `channel` (u8, `RcAgent::channel()` at build) and `hop_epoch`
(u8, echo of the last pair applied) — observability only, nothing waited on
either, and nothing read them; both left the wire in the 2026-09-30 telem
diet (RC_VERSION 13). The drone's channel is whichever channel its video
arrives on, and maburd's own `maburd: retune A -> B (hop)` stderr line
records what it did during a split.

**Drone (`RcAgent`, `drone/src/rc_agent.cpp`).** On an accepted RCF whose
`(hop_epoch, hop_ch)` pair differs from the last one applied — the code
compares the **pair**, not the epoch alone (`r->hop_epoch != hop_epoch_ ||
r->hop_ch != hop_ch_`), matching the spec's "differs from the last pair
applied" over the plan's epoch-only draft — and whose `hop_ch` differs from
the drone's current channel: `Actuator::retune(hop_ch, "hop")` (the same TX-
gate-exclusive, 5 ms-drain, `FastRetune` path every other retune uses,
including TX-power re-application), the move is marked unconfirmed under
the existing `move_confirm_ms` rule, and the drone's stderr line prints
`maburd: retune <a> -> <b> (hop)` — the fourth `reason` value alongside
`disc`/`move_unconfirmed`/`rendezvous`. The retune-deferral during a
calibration sweep applies unchanged. The hop-tracking state (`have_hop_`,
`hop_epoch_`, `hop_ch_`) is reset at all **three** places
`have_last_seq_` is already reset for the same reason (a restarted GS
restarts its epoch numbering from 0, so a latched epoch from an old session
must not swallow the new session's first order): a fresh DISC
(`RcAgent::on_disc`), the move-unconfirmed fallback into RENDEZVOUS, and
FAILSAFE entry.

**GS (`ChannelPlan`, `gs/src/channel_plan.h/.cpp`) — two cards:**
1. `HopController::order()` bumps `epoch_`, sets the standing `hop_ch()`,
   and `VrxController::set_hop()`/`restore_rung()`/`blank_store()` run
   synchronously so **this same tick's** RCF already carries the new pair
   and `ref_rung`'s profile (`gs/src/main.cpp`'s `HopAction::Order` case).
2. `ChannelPlan::hop_order(now, target, lead_card)` sends the non-TX card
   (`lead_card` = `pick_hop_lead()` in `gs/src/scout_pick.h`: the first
   `ready()` card the TX selector is not using, any type; with none ready
   the tick runs the one-card path, `n_cards` 1; picked on the Order tick
   and held while `Ordered`, since a relay lead reads `!ready()` from its
   own `TUNE` until the relay confirms the target) to the
   target (a CPE510 relay card can be the lead: its retune sends `TUNE`,
   and the verdict and confirmation wait on its `ready()` and the relay's
   own `rx_channel` stamp — frames are dropped until the relay confirms;
   `docs/cpe510-relay.md`); the TX card stays on the old channel (`ChannelPlan::desired()`
   returns `op_` for every other card while `hopping_`). Every hop, order
   or withdraw, logs an `M` line (`hop_lead`, `hop_follow`, `hop_withdraw`,
   or `hop_one_card` — new `MoveReason` values alongside `commit`/
   `ack_override` (`split_home`/`reunite` are gone since 2026-10-03: there
   is no home to split from or reunite to, `docs/channel-select.md`).
3. First video AU **genuinely received on the target** by the lead card is
   confirmation: `HopController` emits `Confirm`, `ChannelPlan::
   hop_confirmed()` moves `op_` to the target and the TX card follows
   (`M ... hop_follow`). "Genuinely received on" is
   `RxBody::rx_channel` (`common/include/mabur/node.h`) — the channel the
   producing `RadioFrontend` was known to be tuned to at the instant it
   lifted the frame off the card, stamped there, on the producer thread,
   and carried with the body. It is **not** "where is this card tuned
   now": the core loop drains `BodyQueue` up to a full control tick behind
   the RX threads and `RadioFrontend::retune()` does not flush that queue,
   so bodies received on the OLD channel and still queued when the lead
   card's retune landed were being stamped with the target and confirming
   the hop ~10 ms after the order — before the order's RCF had even left
   the slotter (held to the next end-of-AU, up to ~17 ms) on a link that
   documents 30–50 % RCF uplink loss. The TX card then followed to a
   channel the drone had never been told about, the drone's
   `move_confirm_ms` never armed because it had never moved, and recovery
   was `SplitHome` at 5 s or the drone's own 30 s rendezvous. Because the
   stamp is taken at the source, no amount of queueing downstream can
   change it. `retune()` additionally blanks the stamp to 0 = unknown for
   the duration of the move, so a frame delivered across the retune is
   attributed to neither side of it; 0 never equals a hop target, so it
   simply fails to confirm.
4. No video within `hop.confirm_ms` (code default 500 ms; the bundle ships
   1000 since 2026-09-26 — hops to or from the 8822E spur pairs 149+153 /
   157+161 confirmed in 423–460 ms, and two 506/510 ms withdraws against
   an O4 split the link): `HopController`
   withdraws — epoch bumps again, `hop_ch()` reverts to the old channel,
   the lead card returns, the target is backed off (§5). A drone that had
   already moved sees the withdrawal RCF or times out on its own
   `move_confirm_ms`, which returns it to the channel it hopped FROM
   (`RcAgent::move_from_ch_`) and stays there (no home since 2026-10-03,
   `docs/channel-select.md`). Until 2026-09-26 the
   timeout went straight HOME, so with the hop target == home the drone
   stayed put while the GS sat on the old op — a 60 s split on the bench
   (GS on 112 in a `hold_cap`, drone on home 153). The GS side of the same
   split: the scout's home dwells trickled the drone's frames into
   `feed_video`, so the GS never counted the link lost and
   `split_after_ms` never engaged. Since 2026-09-26 only video received on
   op (or on the hop target while a hop is in flight) refreshes the
   rendezvous silence timer (`ChannelPlan::is_link_video`, keyed on the
   body's `rx_channel`; 0 = unknown still counts).

A second `hop_order()` while one is already in flight (a fresh trigger
before the first attempt resolved) does not leave the abandoned lead card
silently snapping back: `ChannelPlan` self-emits a `HopWithdraw` M-line for
the abandoned attempt before starting the new one, so the flight log
carries a trace of every attempt, even one the controller itself
superseded (`ChannelPlan::hop_order`, `gs/src/channel_plan.cpp`).

**One card, as built.** `HopController`'s own state machine models the
spec's "send `hop.one_card_repeats` (5) times on the old channel, then
retune" sequence: `HopAction::Order` fires first (state → `Ordered`), and
only once `rcf_sent_since_order >= hop.one_card_repeats` with still no
video does it emit a second action, `HopAction::OneCardRetune`
(`gs/src/hop_controller.cpp:ordered_tick`, pinned by
`tests/test_hop_controller.cpp`'s `one_card_retunes_after_repeats`).
`ChannelPlan`'s own one-card contract moves every card — the sole radio —
the instant `hop_order()` runs (`hop_lead_ < 0` → the target for every
card; pinned by `tests/test_channel_plan.cpp`'s
`one_card_hop_moves_all_and_confirms_or_withdraws`), so `gs/src/main.cpp`'s
`HopAction::Order` handler **only calls `plan.hop_order()` when
`act.lead_card >= 0`** (i.e. two cards) — for one card it is skipped on
`Order` and deferred to `OneCardRetune`, so the sole radio stays on the
old channel while `vrx.set_hop()`/`restore_rung()`/`blank_store()` still
fire immediately and the RCF starts carrying the order that same tick.
Only once `OneCardRetune` fires — after `one_card_repeats` RCFs have gone
out on the old channel with no video — does `plan.hop_order(now_ms,
act.target, -1)` run and the radio actually move. This matches the
spec's §1 sequence as written.

During a two-card hop the FEC decodes from one card only; the split is
bounded by `hop.confirm_ms`. `ChannelPlan::desired(card)` answers the
per-card channel exactly as it does for the boot-time split, so the main
loop's mechanical per-card retune (`gs/src/main.cpp`, the loop that drives
every `RadioFrontend` toward `plan.desired(i)`) needed no hop-specific
branch.

## 2. Verdict engine (`gs/src/hop_verdict.{h,cpp}`, pure)

`HopVerdict::window()` runs every `hop.window_ms` (150 ms) while the link
is in `SESSION` and the boot scout owns no card (`hop_active()` in
`hop_burst_gate.h`; the engine is reset on the falling edge — run
unconditionally, the boot rendezvous read as `interfered` and the shadow
controller ordered every candidate before the boot pick had committed),
fed straight from a dedicated read block in `gs/src/main.cpp` (OFDM
FA/CCA via `read_energy_scout()`, foreign-frame and CRC-fail deltas from
the aggregator, RSSI/SNR EMAs converted from devourer raw units by
`rssi_raw_to_dbm()`/`snr_raw_to_db()` in `hop_verdict.h` — the first bench
run fed the raw values and `weak` could never trip) — **a card mid-dwell
that window is skipped**
(`VerdictCardIn::valid = false`). Link-level: the s1 (BASE) pre-FEC loss
window and the FEC recovered-symbol delta. The loss input is the verdict's
own 500 ms window (`s1_hop_loss` in `gs/src/main.cpp`, fed like `s1_loss`),
blanked when a hop lands (`HopAction::Confirm` + 150 ms settle,
`hop_verdict_loss_blank_until` in `gs/src/hop_blank.h`) so a verify is
judged on the channel it verifies; `s1_loss` itself, which feeds the
sideport/ctl-log/OSD gauge, is never blanked.

Seven independent evidence bits, OR'd together every window
(`gs/src/hop_verdict.h`'s `kEvImpaired/kEvWeak/kEvFading/kEvContended/
kEvRaised/kEvBlocked/kEvStarved`):

| bit | rule | key (default) |
|---|---|---|
| impaired | link pre-FEC loss % > `loss_pct` **or** (recovered count > `recovered_x` × its 5 s trailing mean **and** recovered count >= `recovered_min`) **or** `starved` | `hop.verdict.loss_pct` (3.0), `recovered_x` (3.0), `recovered_min` (8) |
| weak | best card's RSSI < `weak_rssi_dbm` **and** SNR < `weak_snr_db` (RSSI alone when that card has no real SNR — `snr_valid` false on a CPE510 relay) | `weak_rssi_dbm` (−78), `weak_snr_db` (12) |
| fading | best card's RSSI more than `fading_drop_db` below its frozen/trailing reference | `fading_drop_db` (6) |
| contended | any card's foreign frames/s > `foreign_pps` | `foreign_pps` (50) |
| raised | any card's FA/s > `fa_pps` | `fa_pps` (100) |
| blocked | the MINIMUM, across cards with a busy reading, of that card's NHM busy % minus its own reconstructed airtime % >= `blocked_pct` | `busy_dbm` (−83), `blocked_pct` (50) |
| starved (0x40) | at least one card valid this window and **zero** own frames on every valid card (`VerdictLinkIn::starved`, set in `main.cpp`'s per-card loop), **or** the window's AU count (`VerdictLinkIn::au_count`, the `au_seq` delta) < `starved_frac` × its trailing mean, when that mean is >= 2 AUs/window | `starved_frac` (0.25; 0 = zero-frames rule only) |

**A CPE510 relay card's inputs (protocol v4, 2026-10-05,
`docs/cpe510-relay.md` "Interference + hop on a relay"):** `cca` is always
0 (ath9k has no CCA-event count), so `raised` on a relay reads off `fa`
alone — OFDM/HT PHY-error count delta (`RemoteCard::read_energy_scout()`)
— the same key, `fa_pps`. `blocked` reads off the relay's `SURVEY` stream
instead of an NHM histogram: `busy_valid`/`nhm_busy_pct` come from a
`SURVEY` delta (same `gen`, span >= 100 ms) as `100·Δbusy/Δactive`, and
`own_air_pct` is `100·Δrx/Δactive` — on the op channel `rx` reads as our
own video, so it plays `own_air_pct`'s usual role of being subtracted back
out. No separate key: `blocked_pct` is shared with the USB NHM path.

**`recovered_min` and `starved` (2026-09-26).** Two holes in `impaired`
found on the long-frame jam bench run. (1) On a clean channel the
recovered term's trailing mean sits near 0.2/window, so 1–5 recovered
symbols read "3× the reference" at 0 % loss; on 112, whose ambient FA
background reads `raised` (240–460/s), that made `interfered` (evidence
0x11) and hopped a link that had 0.0 % pre-FEC loss into a blocked
channel. Session 0232's scan.log had 529 windows impaired only via the
recovered term at <= 3 % loss: recovered 1: 251, 2: 154, 3: 42, 4: 36,
5: 18, 6–8: 10, >8: ~18 — a floor of 8 removes ~97 %. The loss term is
unchanged. (2) A drone starved by a jam (zero frames) read `healthy`: no
frames, no loss. `starved` now counts as impaired; with `blocked` it
classifies `interfered`, alone it falls through to `unknown` like any
unexplained impairment (never a trigger by itself). A starved window is
impaired, so it freezes the references and — like every impaired window —
pushes nothing into the trailing RSSI/recovered histories (`HopVerdict`
only pushes while `!frozen_`, and the freeze happens before the push in
the same window); pinned by `starved_windows_do_not_feed_the_trailing_references`.

**Near-starved (2026-09-26, Task 12 (e)).** A long-frame jam does not
starve the link to zero: session 0232's second jam window saw 5–30 own
frames/s (vs ~3200/s), so the zero-frames rule read "not starved", the
loss tracker had nothing to measure yet, and the window read `healthy` —
breaking the 2-of-3 persistence (loss only showed at +1.05 s, the order
at +1.36 s). `starved` now also fires when the AUs published this window
fall below `starved_frac` (0.25) of the trailing per-window AU mean. The
AU reference follows the recovered one exactly: a 5 s history pushed only
while `!frozen_`, captured at the freeze and used while frozen (so a long
collapse never drags its own baseline down), cleared by `reset()` with the
other snapshots. The AU history and reference (only those) are also
dropped by `HopVerdict::new_session()`, which `main.cpp` calls on the
`hop_active` edge where it re-primes the `au_seq`/recovered baselines —
the frame rate before an outage is no baseline for the session after it.
A mean under 2 AUs/window is no baseline and disables the
term; 60→30 fps low-power is a 0.5 drop, so keep `starved_frac` below it.

`blocked` is the NHM-airtime evidence added 2026-09-25 (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-nhm-airtime-design.md`; bench numbers
in `docs/nhm-airtime-spike-findings-2026-09-25.md`). The other five bits
are all derived from the preamble detector (`foreign`, `fa`) or from RSSI/
SNR, so an interferer that fills airtime without tripping the correlator —
a long-frame 802.11 jam at low pps, or a co-channel analog VTX carrier,
which desenses the front end and reads as a fade with SNR intact
(`docs/analog-vtx-findings-2026-09-25.md`) — was invisible to every one of
them. `nhm_busy_pct` comes from the chip's NHM histogram (airtime above
`radio.scan.busy_dbm`, an `nf::kNhmAbsThDbm` bucket edge — config validation rejects
any other value), armed and read once per verdict window per op card
(§below); `own_air_pct` is the GS's own reconstruction of that card's
airtime from the CRC-good frames it decoded (bytes·8 / HT rate, plus one
preamble per PPDU from the `physt` A-MPDU boundary). A card's busy reading
is invalid — `blocked` simply can't fire off it — under the same kind of
condition that already invalidates a verdict window: the chip has no NHM,
the card was mid-dwell, its channel changed mid-window, or an in-flight
scout dwell landed inside the armed window (caught by a per-card dwell-
generation counter, since `InflightScout::dwell()`'s `FastRetune` doesn't
disturb devourer's NHM-ready state or the period it reports).

`blocked` takes the MINIMUM foreign-busy reading across cards with a
reading, not any single card's (final-review fix, 2026-09-25). A weakly-
receiving diversity card's NHM busy counts our own frames too, but its
`own_air_pct` is reconstructed only from the frames it actually decoded —
so a card that hears little of our own video reads "foreign" close to its
own busy % even with no interferer present, and would false-block alone.
No card with a busy reading this window -> not blocked, same as before;
one-card GS -> the minimum over one card is that card, unchanged.

Verdict, evaluated in this order (`HopVerdict::window`,
`gs/src/hop_verdict.cpp:92-98`):

```cpp
if (!impaired) o.v = Verdict::Healthy;
else if (weak) o.v = Verdict::Fade;
else if (blocked) o.v = Verdict::Interfered;
else if ((contended || raised) && !fading) o.v = Verdict::Interfered;
else o.v = Verdict::Unknown;
```

`blocked` is checked right after `weak` and before the fading gate:
`weak` still wins outright (range edge, a hop does not help), but
`blocked` classifies `interfered` **even while `fading` is also true** —
unlike `contended`/`raised`, which need `!fading`. A real fade lowers RX
power and cannot raise NHM busy airtime, so a window that is both fading
and blocked is desense from an interferer, not a genuine range fade; the
analog-VTX case above is exactly this shape (RSSI −58 → −70…−79, SNR
intact) and is the reason `blocked` beats `fading` rather than being
gated by it the same way `contended`/`raised` are.

`interfered` needs **both** contention/a raised floor **and** the absence
of fading — an impaired, non-weak, non-blocked window that is fading
(RSSI dropped off its reference) but also shows contention or a raised
floor classifies `unknown`, not `interfered`: `weak` is checked first and
wins outright if true, and only among the non-weak, non-blocked windows
does `!fading` gate `interfered` against `unknown`. An edge-of-range but
otherwise stable link showing jammer-like FA/foreign symptoms therefore
classifies `fade` (if also
weak) or `unknown` (if fading but not weak) — never `interfered` — and
neither case hops; the ladder owns both. The `weak`-before-`contended`/
`raised` edge case (`weak` true, `fading` false, `contended`/`raised`
true) was found unpinned by a branch-reorder mutation during review and
is now covered by `weak_takes_priority_over_contended_when_not_fading`.
The hop trigger is
`interfered` in `hop.persist` (2 default) of the last 3 windows
(`VerdictOut::trigger`). `fade` and `unknown` never hop in v1 — the ladder
handles both.

**References.** Per card, a 5 s trailing median of RSSI; link-level, the 5 s
trailing mean of the FEC recovered rate; both frozen at the first impaired
window, along with `ref_rung` (the ladder's rung at that instant), so the
interferer cannot raise its own baseline mid-episode. A card with no
trailing history yet at freeze time (out of range, or mid-dwell) keeps its
reference untouched rather than adopting a fabricated 0 dBm — a real RSSI
reading is never exactly 0, so a frozen reference reading back as 0 is
treated as "no reference yet" and the card's own current RSSI is used
instead (`fading` can't fire off a fabricated reference). Both references
thaw after 3 consecutive `healthy` windows, or after a hop's verify window
ends — `HopVerdict::reset()`, which the trailing histories themselves
survive; only the frozen snapshot (and the latched persistence window) is
cleared. The second rule is driven by `HopAction::VerifyPass`
(§5): `gs/src/main.cpp`'s `apply_hop_action()` calls `reset()` there, and
only there. A `verify_fail` or a `withdraw` re-orders rather than ending
the hop, and §5 has the retry **reuse** the pre-onset `ref_rung`. Thawing
on those would not damage the retry's own `Order` — `order()` reads
`restore_rung` off the cached `VerdictOut`, and `apply_hop_action()` runs
`reset()` after `hopc.tick()` has already built the action. The cost lands
one window later: after a thaw, the next impaired window re-freezes
`ref_rung` at the **mid-hop** rung (already demoted, or already restored),
and the pre-onset value §5 wants reused is gone.

Every `VerdictOut` also carries the wall-clock span its counter deltas
were gathered over (`t_start_ms`, `t_ms` — the previous window's timestamp
and this one's). The consumer needs it: `gs/src/main.cpp` recomputes a
verdict only every `hop.window_ms` but feeds `HopController` on every
~10 ms control tick, so a cached `VerdictOut` routinely outlives the
window that produced it. See §5.

## 3. Scout and ranking (in-session)

**As built, this is a separate pure module, not a `ChannelScout` mode.**
`gs/src/inflight_scout.{h,cpp}`'s `InflightScout` is its own class — the
boot-time `ChannelScout`'s scheduler (round-robin over
candidates-then-home, its own quiet/beacon interleave) is not reusable for
a periodic mid-flight dwell, and the project's new-module convention
(pure, ctest-covered, no hardware) applies the same way it did to
`channel_scout`/`channel_plan`.

**Which card dwells** (since 2026-10-02, `gs/src/scout_pick.h`
`pick_inflight_scout`): the last scout-capable card that is not the TX
card, re-picked every period; none = skip the period. A CPE510 relay card
is never scout-capable (no FA/CCA/NHM reads), so on one USB card plus a
relay the USB card dwells only while the relay holds the uplink — while
the USB card transmits, the periodic scout idles. On an all-USB two-card
GS this is the same "whichever card the TX selector is not using" as
before.

Two-card GS, **auto mode only**: a dedicated thread
(`ChannelCore::scout_loop_`) runs once the boot scout has released every
card. Pinned (`radio.channel = N`), the thread is never started — there is
nothing to rank for — and the spare card stays on diversity.
(`scout_when_disabled`, which kept it dwelling for the Sept observe-only
flights, was deleted 2026-10-04 with `hop.enable`;
`docs/channel-select.md` "Which knob drives which piece".) Every
`hop.dwell_period_ms` (333 ms default):
1. Card = a `ready()` card the TX selector is not using this cycle, never
   a relay. As built (`gs/src/scout_pick.h`): dwells take
   `pick_inflight_scout()` (last scout-capable non-TX card; the loop skips
   it when `!ready()`), the hop freshness burst takes `pick_burst_card()`
   (scout-capable, non-TX preferred), and the hop lead is
   `pick_hop_lead()` (first `ready()` non-TX card — the one pick a relay
   can win, since it leads via `TUNE`). TX card read once at
   cycle start; the selector defers switching onto a card mid-dwell —
   `dwell_busy`/`dwell_card` — and, since the bench, onto a hop's lead
   card while the hop is in flight: `tx_selection_frozen()` in
   `hop_burst_gate.h`. Unfrozen, the RCF carrying the order moved to the
   target channel within 200 ms of three of the first run's four orders).
2. Channel = `InflightScout::next_candidate(fe.channel())`: round-robin
   over the **dwell set** — `radio.channels`, config order, no home
   appended (since 2026-10-03, `docs/channel-select.md`: there is no home
   to append) — skipping the channel the card already sits on (the op
   channel; this loop never runs mid-hop). The rate stays one dwell per
   period whatever the set size; a bigger set only revisits each channel
   less often.
3. Wait for the next AU boundary on that card.
4. `InflightScout::dwell()`: `FastRetune(candidate)` → discard read →
   sleep `hop.dwell_observe_ms` (5 ms) → real read (FA/CCA/frame counters)
   → `FastRetune(back)`.
5. A `D` scan.log line with `sess=1` and the four step-timing columns.

`InflightScout::dwell()` checks **both** retunes' results, not just the
first: if the retune to the candidate fails, or the observation completes
but the return retune to `back` itself fails, the card's true position is
uncertain — a stranded scout card means the aircraft is down to one radio
with no diversity — so `dwell()` sets `kFlagRetuneFailed` on the record and
**returns `false` without populating the `HopVisit`**, rather than booking
a visit gathered around an unknown card position. Recovery is not this
module's job: `gs/src/main.cpp`'s mechanical per-card retune loop (driven
off `plan.desired(card)` every tick, resynced from live hardware —
`cur_ch[card] = fe.channel()` — on every drained dwell) is what notices
and pulls a stranded card back. A failed dwell also does not leak a
phantom zero-score `HopVisit` into the ranker — an early bug (a
default-constructed `HopVisit{ch=0}` pushed unconditionally, which would
have ranked channel 0 as artificially best) was caught and fixed before
this shipped.

**The periodic scout thread stays two-card-only.** `gs/src/main.cpp`
gates its start on `n_cards >= 2` ("no point spinning it up on one card"
— a one-card GS has no spare radio to dedicate to it). A one-card GS's
ranking data comes entirely from the freshness burst below instead.

**Freshness burst.** `gs/src/main.cpp`: rather than act on a ranking that
may be up to `hop.rank_max_age_ms` old, every channel of the dwell set
except the op channel (home included) is swept once,
back to back, via `InflightScout::burst()` whenever the controller has
no hop in flight (`HopState::Idle` **or** `HopState::Hold`) and the
verdict's trigger is set — **on both card counts**, matching the spec's
§3 "the only card on a one-card GS since the link is already impaired."
The gate does not require `ht.best` to already hold a value (an earlier
build's gate did, which on a one-card GS is circular: the burst is the
only source of visits, so requiring a ranked candidate before running it
made the ranker permanently empty — fixed to run the sweep unconditionally
whenever hop-free-and-triggered). Two cards are unaffected either way,
since the periodic scout thread already keeps the ranker warm before any
burst runs.

**Which card bursts** (`pick_burst_card()`, `gs/src/scout_pick.h`, extended
2026-10-05 for the CPE510 relay, `docs/cpe510-relay.md`), first match wins:

1. scout-capable, not TX (USB spare — the link card stays on air)
2. sweep-capable, not TX (relay spare — a v4 `SCAN`; the USB TX card keeps the link)
3. scout-capable TX (one-card USB GS's existing acceptance)
4. sweep-capable TX (**relay-only GS**: no other card exists)
5. none → skip (`-1`)

A sweep-capable pick (2/4 above) runs the relay's async `SCAN` instead of
`InflightScout::burst()`: `ChannelCore` sends one `SCAN` for the dwell set
minus the op channel, polls for the `SCAN_RESULT` on later ticks
(`poll_sweep_()`), and only then feeds the entries into the ranker — the
burst call itself returns immediately rather than blocking the tick for
the sweep's ~280 ms. Each entry becomes one `HopVisit` with `src =
VisitSrc::Relay` (`gs/src/relay_sweep_map.h`); `HopRanker::ranking()` uses
only the **newest visit's source kind**, so a USB dwell set (5 ms,
CCA-event counts) and a relay sweep set (20 ms, survey counts) are never
averaged together. No result within the sweep timeout
(`max(1000, passes·n·(observe_ms+40)+300)` ms, derived from the request;
counted in sideport `hop.sweep_timeouts`) drops the burst
(`sweep_timeout`); while a sweep is pending, `ChannelCore` holds
`ht.verdict.trigger` false so the controller cannot enter `hold_exhausted`
before the result (or the timeout) lands.

The burst is **rate-limited to at most one per `hop.dwell_period_ms`**
(333 ms, USB) **or `hop.relay_burst_period_ms`** (1000 ms default, when the
picked card is a relay — a ~280 ms sweep every 333 ms in a sustained `Hold`
would leave the relay deaf ~85 % of the time; `gs/src/channel_core.cpp`'s
`last_burst_ms_`/`hop_burst_due()`) — reusing the scout thread's own
duty-cycle knob rather than adding a new key for the USB case.
Without this, a sustained `Hold` (every candidate backed off, interference
persisting) re-enters `idle_tick` on every ~10 ms control tick with the
trigger still latched true, and nothing else paces it: `cooldown_ms` only
applies after a confirmed hop, and `max_hops_per_min` is only counted
inside `order()`, neither of which a stuck `Hold` ever reaches. Unlimited,
the burst would fire back to back — and because it runs synchronously on
the core thread, each pass also stalls RX processing for its duration, so
a one-card GS's sole radio would be off-air almost continuously exactly
when the link is already in trouble. Runs with `inflight_mu` held for its
duration, keeping the periodic scout thread (when one is running, i.e.
two-card) off the same `InflightScout`/`RadioFrontend` at once.

**Ranking** (`gs/src/hop_ranker.{h,cpp}`, pure). Per candidate, over the
last `hop.rank_visits` (5) visits not older than `hop.rank_max_age_ms`
(10 000 ms): `score = Σ (fa + max(cca − own, 0) + 4·foreign)`. Fewer than
2 fresh visits = unranked, never chosen. Lowest score wins; deterministic
tiebreak is **boot-time pick, then config order** (spec
2026-10-03-auto-channel-set §5: "ties → boot-time pick, then config
order" — no home; `tests/test_hop_ranker.cpp`'s
`tie_break_falls_through_to_config_order`). An earlier build's tiebreak
was boot-time pick, then the configured home, then config order; there is
no home any more, so that middle term is gone — ranked-clean ties among
candidates fall straight to config order now, same as an unranked entry
always did. The **boot-time pick is published after construction**
(`HopRanker::set_boot_pick()`, called from `gs/src/main.cpp` at the first
DiscAck, next to the `K` scan.log pick line): the boot scan has not
resolved when the ranker is built, so until it is set the tiebreak falls
straight through to config order
(`no_boot_pick_falls_through_to_config_order`). The pick is published only
when the scan actually measured something (some channel reached
`min_rounds`); with no boot scan at all, or a drone that appeared before
any channel ranked, `boot_pick` stays 0 — never a real channel.
Candidates = `radio.channels` (since 2026-10-03, `docs/channel-select.md`
— the same set `HopRanker` is constructed over in `gs/src/main.cpp`, no
home appended), the same set the boot scout ranks and the same set
`InflightScout` dwells on, so `HopRanker::add()`'s silent no-op for a
channel outside the set can never actually drop a real visit.

**Blocked tier (2026-09-25).** Each `HopVisit` carries the same NHM
busy-airtime reading the verdict uses (`busy_valid`/`busy_pct`, armed by
`InflightScout::dwell()` for `dwell_observe_ms` right after the discard
read and collected before the FA/CCA pass, no own-airtime subtraction
needed since none of our frames land on a candidate). `HopRankEntry.busy_pct`
is the **mean** over an entry's fresh, `busy_valid` visits (a 5 ms window
on a bursty interferer reads 0 or 100, so a single visit is not trusted);
an entry is `blocked` when that mean is `>= radio.scan.blocked_pct`. This
is tiering, not a weight added into `score`: `ranking()`'s sort puts every
blocked-but-ranked entry after every unblocked-but-ranked one regardless
of event score, tiebreaking a blocked-vs-blocked pair by lower `busy_pct`
before falling through to the existing score/boot-pick/home/config-order
chain. A channel with events but no busy evidence at all (no NHM, or every
visit invalid) ranks purely on score as before — the tier only ever adds a
worse rank, never a better one. Rationale and defaults in
`docs/nhm-airtime-spike-findings-2026-09-25.md`.

At `radio.width = 40` dwells keep the 40 MHz tuning and score the primary
only, and the ranker stays built over the same primaries as at 20 MHz. That
suffices: boot-scan visits never reach `HopRanker::add()` (only
`inflight.burst()` and the in-flight dwells do, both on primaries), and every
candidate is a pair primary sharing home's `ht40_offset` (a GS config rule),
which FastRetune keeps — so every ranked channel is also a valid hop target.
The per-half boot scan is `ChannelScout`'s alone (`pair_pick.h`,
`scan_half_set`); scan.log is `scanlog 4` (`docs/bw40.md`).

## 4. Ladder interaction: restore the pre-onset rung

- `ref_rung` is snapshotted by `HopVerdict` at the first impaired window
  (§2) and rides the hop-order RCF as `profile`/`fec_overhead_*`.
- **The ladder runs unfrozen during detection** — the spec's explicit
  requirement ("a demote or two, each an IDR" is accepted, not
  suppressed). What gates is narrower than the plan's original brief: only
  `LadderController::blank_store()` (the rung store's residual/util EWMA
  writes) is suspended — s3 demote **decisions** (`s3_live`, the residual
  and util checks) keep running the whole time, so a genuinely-fading enh
  layer can still demote itself before the base layer degrades, exactly as
  the spec intends. A demote taken on mid-hop, one-card evidence is priced
  in by the same spec sentence, and `restore()` overwrites it once the hop
  lands; the per-rung EWMA store stays uncontaminated regardless, because
  it was never written to during the blank.
- **The blank starts at the first `interfered` window**, not at the order,
  from two call sites that compose because
  `LadderController::blank_store()` keeps the LATER of the deadlines it is
  given:
  1. `gs/src/hop_blank.h`'s `hop_store_blank_until()` — pure and
     unit-tested like `hop_burst_gate.h`, called from the verdict block in
     `gs/src/main.cpp` — returns `t_ms + confirm_ms + 150 ms` **once per
     impaired episode**, on the first `interfered` window of it
     (`VerdictOut::first_interfered`).
  2. `HopAction::Order` still calls `vrx.blank_store(now_ms +
     hcfg.confirm_ms + 150.0)`, from the order.

  Previously only (2) existed, so the ~300–450 ms of detection windows
  before the persistence gate tripped an order — including the demotes the
  spec explicitly expects, "a demote or two, each an IDR" — were written
  into the per-rung EWMA store against the interfered channel, which is
  exactly the pollution `blank_store` exists to prevent.

  Three gates on (1), each load-bearing:

  - **Pinned.** `radio.channel = N`: the reactive layer is off, nothing is
    ordered and the rung is never restored, so there is no hop to protect
    the store from — and blanking anyway would silently change what a
    pinned flight records. (2) never fires pinned either (the controller
    is never fed a trigger); this keeps the two consistent. (Until
    2026-10-04 this gate was `hop.enable`.)
  - **`interfered`, not `impaired`.** `VerdictOut::ref_frozen` is keyed on
    `impaired`, and `fade` (impaired ∧ weak) and `unknown` (impaired
    otherwise) are impaired too — so keying the blank on it suspended the
    store's EWMA writes through every fade and every unknown window, while
    this section's last bullet is "`fade`/`unknown`: unchanged ladder
    behaviour". Only interference hops, so only interference blanks.
  - **One edge per frozen episode**, which is what bounds it. The deadline
    is computed once, at onset, and is not re-extended by later
    `interfered` windows — so a jam running for seconds, or one
    alternating `interfered` and `healthy` windows without ever reaching
    the 3 consecutive healthy windows a thaw needs, cannot roll it
    forward. The store resumes `confirm_ms + 150 ms` after onset whether
    or not a hop was ever ordered. Re-arming needs a genuine thaw: 3
    healthy windows, or `HopVerdict::reset()` after a verify window ends.

  Any part of the verify window past `confirm_ms + 150 ms` is still
  outside the blank and updates the store normally.
- On the GS, `HopAction::Order` also calls
  `VrxController::restore_rung(ref_rung, now_ms)` → `LadderController::
  restore()`: rung set directly, probation cleared, probe-before-promote
  skipped, logged as ctl.log event reason `hop_restore`. This fires
  **synchronously at order time**, not at lead-confirm or verify-pass — so
  on a real flight `video → restore` can be negative, and
  `tools/flightreport.py` anchors its restore-match window to the order
  timestamp for exactly this reason (§8, and Known limitations).
- After the blank window, normal store-write rules resume; encoder
  bitrate follows the rung as always.
- `fade`/`unknown` verdicts: unchanged ladder behaviour — no restore, no
  blank, the ladder alone decides.

## 5. Verify, roll back, rate limits

`HopController` (`gs/src/hop_controller.{h,cpp}`, pure) owns all of this;
`gs/src/main.cpp` only translates its `HopAction`s into `ChannelPlan`/
`VrxController`/scan.log calls.

- **No verify for a pinned relocation** (`HopTick::no_verify`, 2026-10-04).
  A relocation onto the pin has nowhere else to go, so the verify's
  question is empty: the Confirm lands it and `VerifyPass` follows on the
  next tick (one action per tick), the pin is never backed off, `holds`
  stays 0. Without it a dirty pin read as a failed hop — bench 2026-10-04,
  `verify_fail` +332 ms on relocate 64 → 40 under the 36-48 router, then
  "relocation to 40 did not land; staying on 40". Set by `ChannelCore` only
  when `!reactive_`; a relocation onto an auto pick keeps the verify below.
- **Verify window** `hop.verify_ms` (1000 ms) after confirmation:
  - `healthy`/`fade`/`unknown` throughout → stands (only a raw
    `Verdict::Interfered` window inside `verifying_tick` breaks it early);
    `verify_pass` logged, the landed channel's backoff cleared, `hops_++`,
    and a `HopAction::VerifyPass` emitted for the caller to thaw the
    verdict references with (§2).
  - **Only a verdict measured entirely after the hop landed can fail the
    verify.** `verifying_tick` compares `VerdictOut::t_start_ms` against
    its own `verify_start_` and ignores anything older. Without this the
    machine failed the verify of a perfectly good channel ~10 ms after
    landing on it: `gs/src/main.cpp` recomputes a verdict every
    `hop.window_ms` (150 ms) but ticks the controller every ~10 ms, so the
    cached `VerdictOut` immediately after a `Confirm` is always the one
    measured before or during the hop, on the old channel — `interfered`
    by construction, since that is why we hopped. It backed the
    just-landed channel off for 30 s, ordered the next candidate, and
    repeated: four orders in ~0.5 s, then `hold_cap`, with the backoff
    doubling 30 → 60 → 120 s, so after two interference events the feature
    had disabled itself for minutes having blacklisted the good channels.
    `t_start_ms` rather than `t_ms` because a window that merely *ends*
    after the confirm gathered most of its deltas on the old channel. The
    cost is one window of detection latency; the first eligible window
    lands ~2 × `window_ms` after the confirm, leaving five inside a
    1000 ms verify. Since 2026-09-24 the bound is the confirm **plus the
    150 ms landing settle** (`kHopSettleBlankMs`): the hop's own retune gap
    is still being repaired then, and those repairs read as `recovered`
    symbols — 40 failed a verify on 85 then 32 of them at 0 % loss, in a
    window starting 27 ms after landing. The first eligible window now
    lands ~3 × `window_ms` after the confirm, leaving four.
  - `interfered` inside the window → the target is backed off
    `hop.backoff_ms` (30 000 ms, **doubling per repeat, capped at
    300 000 ms**), and the controller hops again to the next-ranked
    candidate (excluding anything currently backed off) with no new
    detection delay — `ref_rung` from the triggering verdict is reused, not
    re-snapshotted.
  - No video within `hop.confirm_ms` while `Ordered` → withdrawal (§1),
    same backoff — unless the op reads blocked (next bullet).
- **Confirm extension: undelivered orders are not failures** (2026-09-26,
  Task 12 (f)). In GS session 0232 the jammer sat next to the drone, so it
  jammed the uplink too: the order (carried by every RCF, ~20/s) never
  reached the drone, the GS withdrew at `confirm_ms` and backed the clean
  target (112) off as **failed**, the escape (which skips failed) had
  nowhere to go, and the link held 30 s on 144 at 95–99 % loss. Now, once
  `confirm_ms` has passed without a confirm, if `hop.confirm_extend_ms`
  (3000) > `confirm_ms` **and** the current verdict carries `kEvBlocked`
  **and** the order is younger than `confirm_extend_ms`, the controller
  stays `Ordered` — no action, the RCFs keep carrying the order — and logs
  one H `confirm_extend` (elapsed = time since the order) the first time.
  When it finally withdraws, an order that entered the extension logs
  `withdraw_undelivered` and backs the target off as **undelivered**;
  otherwise it is today's `withdraw` / failed. The extension is engaged
  only by a blocked verdict at the `confirm_ms` expiry, but once engaged it
  holds to `confirm_extend_ms` whatever later windows say — the jam lifting
  is exactly when the order lands, and withdrawing then would race the
  drone's retune into a `move_unconfirmed` split. A confirm during the
  extension proceeds to `Verifying` as usual. A session loss during the
  extension backs the target off as **failed** (the unchanged
  `on_session_lost` rule). `confirm_extend_ms <= confirm_ms` (e.g. 400
  with `confirm_ms` 500, or 0) never extends. Undelivered is
  in `backed_off()` (the normal ranker still skips it) but not in
  `backed_off_failed()`, so the escape may target it; a later
  `verify_pass` on it erases the back-off like any other.
  `on_session_lost` still records failed, and the one-card
  `OneCardRetune` path is unchanged.
- **The op verdict runs on op-channel cards only** (2026-09-26, found
  with the extension). `main.cpp`'s verdict loop skips a card whose tuned
  channel is not `plan.op()` exactly like a card mid-dwell
  (`verdict_card_usable`, `gs/src/hop_burst_gate.h`): no foreign/FA/CCA,
  busy or starved input. Before, a hop's lead card parked on the target
  during `Ordered` fed its clean-target readings into the op verdict — a
  latent bug that, through `blocked`'s min-across-cards rule, cleared
  `kEvBlocked` within ~3 windows of every order, which would have
  disabled the extension on a two-card GS. Consequences: during `Ordered`
  the op verdict runs on the TX card alone; on a one-card GS after
  `OneCardRetune` there is no valid card (`unknown`, no `kEvBlocked`), so
  the extension does not engage there and the order withdraws at
  `confirm_ms` as before.
- **The channel a trigger flees is backed off too** (same schedule as a
  failed target, `HopController::flee`). Before 2026-09-24 only failed
  targets were, so when the first target failed its verify the retry could
  go straight back to the channel just fled — and the in-flight ranker
  (event counts over 5 ms dwells) scores a long-frame jammer low, so it
  did (bench, GS session 0207: 144 → 128 → 144). A withdraw still returns
  to it: that path restores op, it does not consult the ranker. At the
  time this bug was found the fallback for "nothing ranked" was to order
  home, with its own backed-off/blocked checks
  (`HopController::home_available`, `HopTick::home_blocked`). Since
  2026-10-03 there is no home to fall back to at all
  (`docs/channel-select.md`): both members are gone, and "nothing ranked"
  simply holds (`hold_exhausted`, below) — see the Exhaustion bullet.
- **Never hop into a blocked channel** (2026-09-26). Every
  `ranker.best()` that feeds `HopTick::best` passes `require_unblocked`,
  so a channel whose fresh dwells average `>= radio.scan.blocked_pct` busy is never
  ordered — `ranking()` keeps the blocked tier ("least busy first among
  blocked") for display and logs only. Before, "all blocked → least busy
  wins" handed back 136, which every in-flight dwell had read 99.6–100 %
  busy (the jammer on 144 leaked into 132 and 136); its verify failed and
  the link sat ~33 s on it in `hold_exhausted`. When every option is
  blocked the controller now holds on the existing paths instead.
- **Back-off reasons and the escape** (2026-09-26). Each back-off entry
  records why: `fled` (`flee()`), `failed` (verify fail, withdraw,
  session lost) or `undelivered` (a withdraw after a confirm extension,
  see above). A later back-off of the same channel overwrites the
  reason and keeps doubling. `backed_off()` still returns both;
  `backed_off_failed()` only the failed ones. `main.cpp` fills
  `HopTick::escape` = `ranker.best(op, backed_off_failed(), require_unblocked)`
  — fled channels allowed, verify-failed and blocked never. The controller
  orders it (H kind `escape`) only when there is no `best`, the current
  verdict carries `kEvBlocked` (the channel the link is on is itself
  blocked) and `max_hops_per_min` allows it (`HopController::
  escape_allowed`; there is no home-unavailable condition to check any
  more, `docs/channel-select.md`): in
  `idle_tick` before `hold_exhausted` (after the existing cooldown check),
  and in `verifying_tick`'s verify-fail branch before its `verify_fail`
  hold (cooldown exempt, hop cap counted, like any retry — a full cap logs
  `hold_cap`). The escape target then runs the normal Ordered/Verifying
  flow. On the bench this is the missing move: 112 had carried video and
  was only backed off as fled, while the link sat on the blocked 136.
- **Session lost mid-hop** (`HopController::on_session_lost`, called on
  `hop_active`'s falling edge). The controller is only ticked in SESSION,
  and `ChannelPlan::tick` ignores link loss while a hop is in flight, so an
  order still waiting for its confirm when the session dropped used to
  freeze both: lead card on the target, trailing card on the old op, no
  `split_home`, the drone's DiscAcks ignored (`plan.hopping()`), while the
  drone had gone home on `move_confirm_ms` — link down until a GS restart
  (bench 2026-09-24, session 0207). Now an `Ordered` hop is withdrawn at
  that edge like a `confirm_ms` timeout (target backed off, epoch bumped,
  `session_lost` logged), which frees the plan's own link-loss path: since
  2026-10-03 that is `ChannelPlan::release_scout()` handing the spare card
  to the search scout after `search_after_ms`, not a move to home
  (`docs/channel-select.md` — there is no home to send a card to any
  more). A `Verifying` hop (already confirmed, so the plan's op has moved)
  just drops its stale verify.
- **Exhaustion.** All candidates backed off or unranked: hold
  (`hold_exhausted`, no retune — the ladder copes). Before 2026-10-03 the
  fallback was home if not already there; there is no home now, so this is
  the only outcome. Automatically retried once a shorter backoff expires
  and a new trigger fires (there is no timer of its own; the next
  `interfered` window re-evaluates `ranker.best()`).
- **A hold is a state, and only its EDGES are logged and counted.**
  `idle_tick()` runs from `Hold` as well as `Idle`, so a held controller
  with the trigger still latched re-enters the hold branch on every ~10 ms
  control tick. Logging per tick pushed an `H` line into `scan.log` **and**
  a line to stderr at ~100 Hz (~10 KB/s each) and turned `hop.holds` on
  the sideport into a meaningless six-digit ramp — worst on the Sept
  observe-only flights (`hop.enable = false`, deleted 2026-10-04), where
  the then-shadow FSM ran the same loop and filled the log with
  `would_hold_cap`. As built: entering logs one event naming the
  reason (`hold_cap`, `hold_exhausted`, or `verify_fail`) and bumps
  `holds()` once; re-entering while already held logs nothing; leaving
  logs one `hold_end` whose `elapsed_ms` is how long the episode lasted.
  `hop.holds` therefore counts hold **episodes**. A hold also now ends
  when the trigger clears — every other way out runs through `order()`,
  which needs a live trigger, so without that exit `hop.state` read
  `hold` for the rest of the flight after a single exhausted episode and
  no `hold_end` ever closed it.
- **Rate limits.** `hop.max_hops_per_min` (4) **includes verify-fail
  retries** — only `hop.cooldown_ms` (2000 ms, between a confirmed hop and
  the next fresh trigger) exempts them. This is a deliberate reading of
  the spec's own sentence structure ("including retries, then hold" vs.
  "verify-window retries exempt" applying only to the cooldown clause,
  not the cap) — the original implementation generalised the cooldown
  exemption to the cap too, letting a genuinely bad link retry unbounded
  (8 orders in under a second against a cap of 4, in one review probe);
  fixed and pinned by `verify_fail_retries_count_against_rate_cap`. Hitting
  the cap mid-verify-retry logs `hold_cap` and does not self-perpetuate —
  the 60 s trailing window (`hop_times_`) slides and the next trigger
  after it clears retries normally.
- **Kill switch (history).** Until 2026-10-04 `hop.enable = false` ran
  the whole machine in shadow — verdict, ranker, controller ticks,
  scan.log — with `tick()` zeroing the action and every event
  `would_`-prefixed (`would_order`, `would_withdraw`, …); the Sept flights
  flew that way. Deleted: the mode knob is `radio.channel` alone
  (`docs/channel-select.md` "Which knob drives which piece"), and
  `HopController` is mode-agnostic — it acts on what `ChannelCore` feeds it,
  which pinned is relocations only. Recordings from those flights carry
  `would_` rows and `flightreport.py` still prints them as SHADOW; no
  later build emits one.
- **Convergence.** The drone obeys only the newest `(hop_epoch, hop_ch)`
  pair and homes on `move_confirm_ms`; the GS waits only for video and
  withdraws on `confirm_ms`; the boot-time rendezvous machinery is
  untouched. Worst-case disagreement window is bounded by
  `move_confirm_ms + split_after_ms`, same as at boot.

## 6. devourer (Jaguar3)

`GetRxEnergyScout()` (OFDM FA + CCA, delta-on-read like `GetRxEnergy`) and
a batched-control-transfer path (precedent: the InitWrite async write
queue) landed on `../devourer` ahead of this plan and are consumed
unmodified — no devourer change was part of this task's scope. The
spike's "~10 ms with the batched path, 26 ms without" planning figures are
in the design spec; the measured figure from the real GS path is one of
the numbers `docs/handover-inflight-hop-bench-2026-09-15.md` still owes.

## 7. Config

Since 2026-10-03 (`docs/channel-select.md`) `HopController` takes no home
parameter at all — its constructor is just `HopController(HopCfg cfg)`,
and `gs/src/hop_controller.h`'s own comment says so ("No home: this
feature has no fallback channel any more"). The same date adds a second
`H` (hop event) kind, `relocate` (named `boot_order` until 2026-10-04) —
the order that moves the link from where the drone was found to where it
should live (`ChannelPlan::want()`: the pin, or the boot pick — the boot
hop is a relocation), placed through this same controller
(`docs/channel-select.md` "Finding the drone"). `HopTick::relocate`: no
flee of the channel left, exempt from `cooldown_ms`, counted against
`max_hops_per_min`. No config key changed for either of these.

**`[hop]` has no on/off switch** (2026-10-04). The reactive hop runs in
auto mode only; `radio.channel = N` is static. `busy_dbm`/`blocked_pct`
are `radio.scan.busy_dbm`/`blocked_pct` since the same date: every
measurer reads them, so they left `[hop.verdict]`
(`docs/channel-select.md` "Which knob drives which piece"). The block
below is the shape that shipped 2026-09-14, kept for the recordings made
under it.

`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`, `[hop]`/`[hop.verdict]` (drone config
unchanged — the drone has no hop config of its own, it just obeys
whatever `hop_ch`/`hop_epoch` arrive on the RCF):

```toml

```

`recovered_min` (added 2026-09-26, §2) is the floor under the recovered
term of `impaired`; 0 disables it. `starved_frac` (added 2026-09-26, §2)
is the AU-rate collapse that reads `starved`; 0 disables the AU term.
`[hop] confirm_extend_ms` (added 2026-09-26, §5) is how long an
unconfirmed order is kept while the op reads blocked; <= `confirm_ms`
(e.g. 0) disables the extension.

`busy_dbm`/`blocked_pct` (added 2026-09-25, spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-nhm-airtime-design.md`) feed the
`blocked` evidence bit (§2) and are shared unchanged by both rankers
(§3); the spec's own draft carried a provisional `blocked_pct = 30`, the
hw spike (`docs/nhm-airtime-spike-findings-2026-09-25.md`) replaced it
with 50 — midway between the worst clean-channel error (~10 in a single
window) and a real interferer's reading (95–99).

Validation (`gs/src/config.cpp`), same fail-fast style as `radio.scan` —
unknown keys fail boot:

| key | range |
|---|---|
| `window_ms` | 50–2000 |
| `persist` | 1–3 |
| `dwell_observe_ms` | 1–250 |

| `max_hops_per_min` | 1–60 |
| `backoff_ms` | 1000–600000 |
| `one_card_repeats` | 1–50 |
| `hop.verdict.loss_pct` | 0.1–100.0 |
| `hop.verdict.recovered_x` | 1.0–100.0 |
| `hop.verdict.recovered_min` | 0–1000 (0 = no floor) |
| `hop.verdict.weak_rssi_dbm` | −110 – −20 |
| `hop.verdict.weak_snr_db` | 0–40 |
| `hop.verdict.fading_drop_db` | 1–40 |
| `hop.verdict.foreign_pps` | 1–100000 |
| `hop.verdict.fa_pps` | 1–100000 |
| `radio.scan.busy_dbm` (was `hop.verdict.busy_dbm`) | −104 – −70, must sit on an `nf::kNhmAbsThDbm` bucket edge |
| `radio.scan.blocked_pct` (was `hop.verdict.blocked_pct`) | 1.0–100.0 |
| `hop.verdict.starved_frac` | 0.0–1.0 (0 = zero-own-frames rule only) |

`[hop]`/`[hop.verdict]` were wholly new sections with defaults for every
key, so an old config without them booted unchanged on the new binary
(`enable` then defaulted `false`) — but `RC_VERSION` still forced the binary
flag day described in §1, since the RCF/Telem shapes changed regardless of
config.

## 8. Observability

**`scan.log`, marker `scanlog 4`** (`gs/src/scan_log.h/.cpp`; formats
locked by `tests/test_scan_log.cpp`; bumped from `scanlog 3` by the NHM
airtime work, 2026-09-25 — see `docs/data-provenance.md` for the break).
The marker has since moved on to `scanlog 5` (2026-10-03, the channel set
replacing home + candidates — §7 above and `docs/channel-select.md`), then
`scanlog 6` (2026-10-05, the CPE510 relay's interference sweep/hop,
`docs/cpe510-relay.md`); every record kind this section documents is
unchanged by those bumps except `M` (loses the `split_home`/`reunite`
reasons; gains `link_found` 2026-10-04), `H` (gains `relocate`, below) and
`D` (gains a trailing `<rx|->` — a relay sweep entry's rx % of the
observe, `-` for a USB dwell or an invalid relay reading; `scanlog 6`).
The `A` (1 Hz in-flight energy) record and `radio.scan.energy_period_ms`
are **gone** — the verdict engine's window reads replace them, feeding
`cards[i].energy` on the sideport continuously in-session instead of once
a second (§below). Two new record kinds:

```
V <t> <verdict> <evidence_hex> <ref_rung|-> <link_loss_pct> <recovered>
  [<card> <foreign> <fa> <cca> <crc> <rssi> <snr> <drssi> <nhm_busy|->
   <own_air>]...                                             # a verdict window
H <t> <kind> <epoch> <target> <score> <elapsed_ms>            # a hop event
```

- **V** — one per `HopVerdict::window()` call **that changed the verdict
  or was non-healthy** (not every 150 ms window unconditionally). Per-card
  block order is `foreign fa cca crc rssi snr drssi` (task review caught
  and fixed a fixture/golden mismatch here before shipping — the wire
  order is authoritative), followed since `scanlog 4` by `nhm_busy`
  (`-` when the card's NHM window didn't cover this verdict window on this
  channel — see the invalidation list in §2) and `own_air` (always
  present, % of the window). `drssi` is the **link-level** `d_rssi_db`
  (best-card RSSI minus its reference), repeated identically in every
  card's chunk, not a genuinely per-card value. The evidence field is the
  §2 bitmask in hex: impaired 0x01, weak 0x02, fading 0x04, contended
  0x08, raised 0x10, blocked 0x20, starved 0x40 (0x40 added 2026-09-26,
  additive — the marker stays `scanlog 4`).
- **H** — one per `HopController` state transition or logged decision.
  `kind` is always a single snake_case token — `order`, `lead_confirm`,
  `one_card_retune`, `verify_pass`, `verify_fail`, `escape`, `withdraw`, `session_lost`, `hold_cap`,
  `hold_exhausted`, `hold_end`, `confirm_extend`, `withdraw_undelivered`,
  `relocate`
  (`escape`, added 2026-09-26 under the same
  `scanlog 4` marker, is an order placed to leave a blocked channel, §5;
  `confirm_extend` / `withdraw_undelivered`, added the same day, same
  marker, are the confirm extension's entry and its expiry, §5;
  `relocate`, added 2026-10-04 under `scanlog 5` (the pre-merge
  2026-10-03 bench builds logged it as `boot_order`), is the order that
  moves the link to `ChannelPlan::want()` — the pin, or the boot pick, the
  boot hop being one — placed through this same controller; a relocation
  is the one hop a pinned GS places — §7 above and
  `docs/channel-select.md` "Finding the drone"; the hold pair used to be the two-word C++ strings
  `"hold cap"`/`"hold exhausted"`, a space-delimited field containing the
  delimiter — fixed at the emitter rather than kept as a parser
  workaround, since scan.log is designed to outlive the code that wrote
  it). Before 2026-10-04 `hop.enable = false` prefixed every kind with
  `would_` (shadow mode, deleted); such rows exist only in older
  recordings. Note:
  there is no `trail_follow` H-kind — the trailing card following the lead
  is an `M` line (`hop_follow`), not an `H` line; the spec's sketch listed
  it as an H event. `hold_end` closes a hold episode opened by
  `hold_cap`/`hold_exhausted`/`verify_fail`, and its `elapsed_ms` is the
  episode's duration (§5). `tools/flightreport.py` treats it as a
  **terminal** kind, defensively: the controller does not currently emit a
  `hold_end` while a hop-attempt row is open (a hold entry closes the row
  first, and `verifying_tick`'s terminal `verify_fail` carries an
  *unbumped* epoch, so `build_hop_rows`' epoch-match branch reads it as
  the outcome rather than as a retry), but an unrecognised kind arriving
  with a row open falls through to `unterminated` — "the log ends
  mid-attempt" — which would misreport a flight that in fact ended in a
  hold.
- **D** — extended, not replaced: the existing boot-scout dwell line gains
  a trailing `<sess> <to_us> <read_us> <back_us>` (in-session flag + the
  three step timings). Boot-time dwells still emit valid lines with these
  four fields at their defaults (`0 0 0 0`). Since `scanlog 4` a further
  trailing `<busy|->` carries the NHM busy % over the dwell's observe span
  (`-` when the card has no NHM or the dwell's busy read was invalid);
  format and the `K` pick line's matching `<busy|->` addition are in
  `docs/channel-select.md`, since both records are shared with the
  boot-time scan. Since `scanlog 6` (2026-10-05) a further trailing
  `<rx|->` carries a relay sweep entry's rx % of the observe (`-` for a
  USB dwell, which has no rx reading, or an invalid relay reading);
  `sweep_dwell()` (`gs/src/relay_sweep_map.h`) is what builds one of these
  from a `SCAN_RESULT` entry — see `docs/cpe510-relay.md`.

Full boot-time record formats (`C`/`K`/`M`) are unchanged and still
documented in `docs/channel-select.md`.

**ctl.log:** new event reason `hop_restore` (§4).

**Sideport** (`gs/src/stats_exporter.{h,cpp}`). New top-level `hop` object,
straight from `HopController`'s own accessors plus the latest
`HopVerdict::window()` output, unconditional (a disabled feature still
exports `enable: false` and idle defaults, matching the existing
`link.probe` pattern):

```
hop: {
  enable, verdict, evidence, ref_rung (null while unfrozen),
  epoch, state (idle|ordered|verifying|hold),
  target (null before the first-ever order), hops,
  holds (hold EPISODES entered, not ticks held — §5),
  last_ms (elapsed_ms of the most recent HopEvent, null until one fires)
}
```

Per-card `cards[i].dwell` (null until that card has completed at least one
dwell): `{visits, score, cost_us}` — `visits` is cumulative over every
completed dwell (success or failure), `score`/`cost_us` are the **last**
successful dwell's, not an aggregate (a failed retune produces no
`HopVisit` to score, so a stale score is kept rather than zeroed).
`cards[i].energy` is refilled every ~150 ms verdict window instead of once
a second from the deleted A-record poll — noisier tick-to-tick, but it
never goes stale for up to a second the way the old poll could. Since
2026-09-25 it also carries `busy_pct`/`own_air_pct` (both `null` when the
window's busy reading was invalid or none has landed yet), the same
`nhm_busy_pct`/`own_air_pct` the verdict computes — see §2 and
`docs/observability.md`.

**`tools/maburtop.py`:** the header line gains `hop <state>/<verdict>`
next to the existing `scan <state>:<rounds>`; the per-card `busy` column
(`(cca − min(cca,own)) + fa + foreign`, the same score the ranker uses)
now tracks `cards[i].energy` at verdict-window cadence rather than the old
1 Hz poll. A further per-card `fbusy` column (renamed from `air%` in the
final-review fix wave: it was always foreign busy, never own airtime)
(`max(0, busy_pct − own_air_pct)`, clamped at 0 so a stale
`own_air_pct` reading past a fresher `busy_pct` can't go negative) shows
the same foreign-busy-airtime figure the `blocked` evidence bit and both
rankers use.

**Player OSD:** the compact bar's `ch:` field appends `(h)` while a hop's
target is the live channel and that target is not `scan.pick`
(`GsSnapshot::hopped`, `gs/player/src/gs_snapshot.cpp`) — **not**
`hop.hops > 0`, which is a monotonic counter that never resets on
withdrawal or on hopping back to the pick and would stay lit forever after
the first confirmed hop. `scan.pick` is the channel the GS froze its boot
pick on (or the pin, in pinned mode) for the process lifetime — latched in
`gs/src/main.cpp`'s `frozen_pick` at the freeze, never the live `op`
(until 2026-10-04 it was published live as `plan.op()`, so after a hop it
followed the target and `(h)` never lit); `hopped` is
false while the pick is still open (`scan.pick` null, boot phase) — that
case is the boot-scan's own `(a)`/`moving` mark, not a reactive hop. `(h)`
and `(a)` share one suffix slot (worst_case() reserves exactly `(a)`'s
width) with `(h)` taking priority, since a mid-flight hop is the more
actionable of the two for the pilot. `(h)` reads false, not stale-true, on
an older maburgs missing `scan` or `hop`.

**`tools/flightreport.py` HOP section** (`print_hop_report`,
`load_scanlog`). Session-mode only (`scan.log` is a sibling of `ctl.log`
in the debug-log session directory; there is no legacy filename
heuristic), and skipped entirely on a `scanlog` version below 2 — the
highest marker in the file, since a GS restart rejoins the session
directory and the first `scan.log` after a deploy starts under the old
binary's header. One row
per hop **attempt** — every event that places a fresh `HopAction::Order`
(`order`, retry-triggering `verify_fail`, and `escape`), matched against ctl.log's
`hop_restore` E-lines by nearest timestamp within a 5 s window anchored on
the attempt's own order/retry time (not lead-confirm, per §4's
synchronous-restore finding):

```
t=<order_ts> target=<ch> [SHADOW]  onset->order <ms>  order->video <ms>  video->restore <ms>  outcome <kind>
```

In a pre-2026-10-04 recording flown with `hop.enable = false` every row is
`would_`-prefixed and printed as
"SHADOW hop(s)" in a separate table rather than being silently folded into
"zero hops" — video never confirms while disabled, so a shadow row's
outcome is structurally almost always a `would_withdraw` timeout, which is
expected, not a bug. On a session with **zero real hops** (the expected
shape of every observe-only flight), the report instead prints:

- the verdict histogram (`healthy`/`fade`/`interfered`/`unknown` counts),
- an evidence-bit tally (`impaired`/`weak`/`fading`/`contended`/`raised`,
  counted over **all** windows, since a window can carry a bit without
  that bit driving the top-level verdict),
- per-card medians (not means — these are counter deltas with outliers)
  of `foreign`/`fa`/`rssi_dbm`/`snr_db` over non-healthy windows —

this was the whole point of the first (Sept, `hop.enable = false`) flights: the
spec's own Open Items call them "the calibration" for five threshold
defaults that are spike numbers, not measurements, and a verdict name
alone cannot say whether `foreign_pps` or `weak_rssi_dbm` was the one
that nearly tripped.

Always printed (2026-09-26): `escapes: N  starved windows: M` — how many
`escape` H events (§5) the session logged and how many V windows carried
the starved bit (evidence & 0x40, §2) — and `confirm extensions: N
undelivered withdraws: M` (the H `confirm_extend` / `withdraw_undelivered`
counts, §5; `withdraw_undelivered` closes its attempt row like a
`withdraw`, `confirm_extend` leaves it open). Then a per-card dwell-cost summary (count and
median(`to_us+read_us+back_us`) for dwells with `sess == 1`, i.e. dwells
that actually cost airtime inside a live session — the free off-session
boot-scan dwells are excluded).

## Measurements

Bench, 2026-09-15 (`docs/handover-inflight-hop-bench-2026-09-15.md` has
the run-by-run record). Two RTL8822EU cards on the GS, the drone on the
bench, interferer = `tools/bench/benchjam.sh` (a spare 8822EU on the host,
QoS-Data 1000 B at 6 Mbit/s, 250 frames/s, ~35 % airtime, `DEVOURER_TX_SA`
set to a non-canonical address so the GS counts it as `foreign`). The
three code fixes the bench forced (verdict units, session gating, TX-card
freeze — commits `dfe09ad`, `fd1b8d5`, `17b7764`) were in place for every
row below except where the row says otherwise. Not run: the non-802.11
(O4) interferer and the fade row (both need hardware the bench did not
have), and no flight yet.

**Dwell cost** (`D` lines with `sess 1`; `to_us` = FastRetune to the
candidate, `read_us` = the real counter read, `back_us` = FastRetune back;
the discard read between retune and observe is not logged separately and
costs about what `read_us` does):

| step | planning figure | measured (median, two cards, 333 ms period) |
|---|---|---|
| retune to candidate (`to_us`) | 4 ms | 2.9–3.2 ms (max 19 ms) |
| discard read | 6.5 ms | ~0.9 ms (not logged; same call as `read_us`) |
| observe (`dwell_observe_ms`) | 5 ms | 5 ms |
| real read (`read_us`) | 6.8 ms | 0.8–1.0 ms (max 19 ms) |
| retune back (`back_us`) | 4 ms | 2.3–2.4 ms (max 5 ms) |
| **total** | **26 ms** (target ~10 ms) | **~12 ms** (`to+read+back` median 6.2–6.5 ms first run, 5.3–5.4 ms over the whole day per `flightreport`; p90 7.7 ms, max 31 ms) |

A candidate that IS the current op channel (the boot pick is always one
of `radio.scan.candidates`) costs nothing to "retune" to (`to_us` 4 us,
`back_us` 2 us) but still spends the 5 ms observe on-channel; a third of
the periodic dwells are that today.

**Bench condition matrix:**

| condition | onset→video (H lines) | rung restored (ctl.log) | ausniff fps/gaps with dwells on |

At default jam power the jam leaked onto every channel: 144→64→40→112 via `verify_fail`, a hold on 112 until the jam stopped, then back to 64 with `verify_pass` | not read | 30.2 fps, 1 frame_id gap (181 ms before the order, jam loss), 0 incomplete over 60 s |

The candidate-jam row is a weaker exclusion than the table reads: a 5 ms
observe catches about one frame of a 250 frame/s jammer, so 149's dwell
score rose from a median of 0 (mean 0.8) to a median of 6 (mean 6.7, max
25) — and 165's rose to 6 as well from near-field leakage. Enough to rank
it below a clean channel, not enough to call it interfered. The same
blindness cuts the other way: the channel the link just left scores ~6
too, so after a `verify_fail` on the target the ranker can pick the
jammed origin channel straight back (seen in the first run; the origin is
not backed off on hop-away). See Known limitations.

**Verdict at rest** (calibration input for `[hop.verdict]`): on the clean
bench link at rung 5, 65 % of windows carry the `impaired` bit and
classify `unknown` — pre-FEC loss never exceeded 2.5 % (threshold 3 %),
but `recovered > recovered_x (3.0) × its 5 s trailing mean` trips on any
single lost aggregate, because the trailing mean is ~4.6 symbols/window
(p50 2) and one lost aggregate recovers 10–26. Consequences: `ref_rung` is
frozen almost continuously (the thaw needs 3 consecutive `healthy`
windows, ~4 % likely at that rate), so the "pre-onset rung" a real hop
restores can be many seconds stale; nothing hops on it, since `unknown`
never triggers. A floor on the recovered term (an absolute count, or a
fraction of expected symbols) is the obvious retune; left to the
observe-only flights per the spec's open items.

## Known limitations

Found on the 2026-09-15 bench (the handover page has the traces):

- ~~A CPE510 relay never bursts~~ — fixed 2026-10-02 for `can_scout` cards,
  then fixed for the relay itself 2026-10-05: `pick_burst_card()` is now a
  5-way order (scout non-TX, sweep non-TX, scout TX, sweep TX, none) and a
  relay-only GS bursts via an async `SCAN` ("Which card bursts" in §3,
  `docs/cpe510-relay.md`).

- **A withdrawn two-card order strands the drone.** The drone retunes on
  the first RCF carrying the order; if the GS withdraws (no video on the
  target within `confirm_ms`), the withdrawal rides RCFs on the OLD
  channel, which the drone — now on the target — cannot hear. It sits
  there for `move_confirm_ms` (2 s), homes, and rendezvous back, and every
  order the GS places meanwhile is sent to a drone that is not listening.
  In the first run that burned the whole `max_hops_per_min` (4) inside
  2 s and the controller held for 36 s under active interference. The
  TX-card freeze (`tx_selection_frozen`) removed the cause of those
  withdrawals; the strand-then-re-order pattern itself is unchanged and
  will recur on any genuine withdrawal. A guard that refuses a new order
  until the drone has been heard again (video, or any Telem on the new
  channel) is the candidate fix.
- **The origin channel is never backed off.** Only withdrawn/failed
  targets are. With a 5 ms observe scoring a 250 frame/s jammer at ~6,
  the jammed channel stays "ranked clean" and is a legal next hop after a
  `verify_fail` on the target (first run: 165 → 149 `verify_fail` → back
  to 165 → `hold_cap`).
- **`fa_pps` 100 is marginal on a busy candidate.** 149 (boot-scan busy
  109–306 on this bench) read FA 70–133/s on both cards after the follow,
  which is what failed that verify. Calibration, not code.
- **One-card hops cost the ladder four rungs** (matrix table): the
  five-RCF order window leaves the drone ahead of the GS by ~200 ms, the
  loss windows are not blanked, and the cascade lands after the confirm.
  `blank_store` covers the rung store only; the demote decisions are the
  knob if this matters in flight.

Carried over from the implementation session:

- **A one-card GS needs two freshness-burst passes before it can hop to
  a real candidate.** `HopRanker` requires at least 2 fresh visits before
  a channel counts as ranked (§3), and on one card the burst — rate-limited
  to one pass per `hop.dwell_period_ms` (§3) — is the only source of
  visits. So the first trigger's burst (which fires immediately) leaves
  every candidate still unranked, `hopc`'s `best` stays `nullopt`, and the
  controller orders home (or holds, if already home); only the *second*
  burst, one `dwell_period_ms` later, gives the ranker enough visits to
  name a candidate. Derived (not measured — no hardware this session)
  figures for the shipped defaults, named by milestone since the two
  differ by a full second: **~633 ms** to the order decision (300 ms
  detection + one 333 ms wait for burst 2); **~883 ms** to the physical
  retune (+ `one_card_repeats` (5) × the RCF period — 250 ms, **not**
  500 ms: the RCF period is `link.feedback_ms`, whose shipped bundle
  default (`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`, 50 ms) overrides the
  struct default in `gs/src/config.h` (100 ms) — computing from the
  header alone gives the wrong, too-pessimistic answer); **~0.9–1.1 s**
  to `Confirm` (video lands on the target, `HopState::Verifying`) — the
  milestone the spec's "under one second" goal is about, since that is
  when video is restored; **~1.9–2.1 s** to `verify_pass` (a further
  `hop.verify_ms`, 1000 ms, before the hop is declared to have stood).
  **These figures are best/typical-case and provisional**: derived from
  config defaults and code paths only, assuming interference present
  continuously from t=0 and phase-aligned onset (no wait for the next
  verdict window or RCF slot); real jitter adds up to ~150 ms
  (verdict-window phase, `hop.window_ms`) and ~50 ms (RCF-cadence phase)
  at the tails, and none of it is measured — pending independent
  re-derivation and, eventually, a bench run. Two-card GSes are
  unaffected — the periodic scout thread keeps the ranker continuously
  warm, so a two-card burst typically finds already-ranked candidates on
  its first pass.
- **A one-card freshness burst takes the sole radio off-air for ~30 ms
  per sweep** (three default candidates, a few ms each). Reconciled the
  same tick: `InflightScout::dwell()`'s own return-to-`back` retune, then
  a `cur_ch` resync from live `fe.channel()`, then (if either failed) the
  ordinary mechanical per-card retune loop — all before the tick ends, not
  deferred to the next one.
- **`dwell_busy`/`dwell_card`'s publish is not atomic** with the
  cross-thread read that gates the mechanical retune loop, the verdict
  window, and the TX selector against a card the scout has mid-dwell
  (`gs/src/main.cpp`). A reader can observe `dwell_busy == false` a few
  instructions before the scout thread flips it and calls `retune()`.
  Deliberately left unfixed: closing it means a lock in the hot per-tick
  path at three call sites, for a nanosecond-scale window whose worst case
  (one mistimed dwell) self-heals within the next tick via
  `plan.desired()`'s own retune loop and the `cur_ch` resync.
- **Burst dwells are invisible to the per-card sideport counters.** The
  pre-order freshness burst (§3) calls `InflightScout::burst()` directly
  and does not feed `dwell_recs`/`dwell_visits`, the vectors that populate
  `cards[i].dwell`. Reading `cards[i].dwell.visits` therefore undercounts
  real scouting activity — the periodic scout's dwells are all there, a
  freshness burst's are not.
- **`RxBody::rx_channel` still has a residual mis-stamp window** of
  however far the USB RX pipeline lags real-time beyond `FastRetune`'s own
  duration (~4 ms of control transfers on this path). `retune()` blanks
  the stamp to 0 before the move and sets the new channel after it, so a
  frame delivered at any point during those ~4 ms is correctly "unknown";
  a frame received on the old channel but not delivered to `on_packet()`
  until after the retune completed would still read as the new channel.
  devourer exposes no RX flush to close it outright. This is a
  microseconds-to-low-milliseconds window against the ~10 ms-plus, every
  single hop, by-construction one it replaces.
- **The 5 s `flightreport.py` `hop_restore` match window is an
  uncalibrated judgement call**, chosen with no flight data to check it
  against. It fails safe: an unmatched restore line prints "not found"
  rather than mis-pairing with the wrong hop attempt.
- **`V` line's `drssi` field is link-level, not per-card**, repeated
  identically across every card's chunk on that line — see §8.
