# Link adaptation — ladder, attribution, fade

How maburgs decides the operating point: the measured-loss ladder, s3
probe-before-promote, transition attribution, the fade regime and its
predictive RF trigger, and the drone-side RCF drain that actuates it.

Read `docs/data-provenance.md` before comparing any two recordings across
dates, and `docs/observability.md` for how to record one in the first
place. Specs (local, gitignored):

## 2-stream UEP + air balancer (2026-08-29, superseded 2026-08-30 — see below)

The video link collapsed from 4 UEP streams (CRIT/T0/T1/T2, wire sids
0-3) to 2: BASE (sid 0) and ENH (sid 1). BASE rode `mcs−1` of the
ladder's scored rung — an always-on, fixed UEP-via-rate rule mirrored
identically on drone and GS (RC_VERSION 4) — while ENH rode the scored
mcs itself; nothing flew above the scored mcs (2026-07-26 rule, still in
force). FEC overhead was LITERAL: the config/wire `overhead` value
*was* the command overhead (`repair/data`), not a per-layer scaling
(the old `uep_layer_overhead`) of it — a single `budget()`/`budget_for(rung)`
pair derived directly as `overhead / (1 + overhead)`, the identical
formula for both sids; `budget3_for()` was gone, `budget_for()` alone
covered what it used to do (the enh/probe rung's budget).

The drone's `AirBalancer` redistributed that one commanded overhead
between BASE and ENH every frame, anchored on ACTUAL emitted bytes
rather than the nominal `len*(1+ov)/rate` model (which measured a
reproducible ~2x gain error at large frames). See
`docs/airtime-balance-spike-findings-2026-08-29.md` for the bench spikes
behind that design. The rate split had a structural floor, though: at
the mcs1 rung's 2:1 base/enh rate ratio the balancer's rails could not
reach air balance (3.3 ms/pair residual alternation) — the motivation
for the same-rate counter-study below.

## Same-rate fixed pairs (2026-08-30) — current architecture

Both streams now ride the SAME scored mcs; the mcs−1 base-rate split
above is gone (`ladder_from` in `common/src/profile.cpp`, 2026-08-30
RULING). UEP is expressed only through FEC overhead, and that overhead
is a fixed **per-rung config pair** — `overhead_base`/`overhead_enh` —
carried in the v5 RCF (RC_VERSION 5), not a single scalar the drone
reallocates at runtime. `LadderController` scores each sid against its
own budget: `budget_base()`/`budget_base_for(rung)` for sid 0 (base),
`budget_enh_for(rung)` for sid 1 (enh/probe/s3) — see
`gs/src/ladder_controller.h`. There is no shared `budget()`/
`budget_for()` anymore.

Since 2026-09-24 a rung is `(bw, mcs)`, not just `mcs`: `[[link.ladder]] bw`
is a required per-rung key and the RCF profile byte already carried width,
so this cost no wire change (`docs/bw40.md`).

**The runtime `AirBalancer` solver is deleted, and so is `AirFeed`.**
The drone applies the commanded overhead pair directly to UEP; there is
no per-frame redistribution or solve. `AirFeed`, the solver's
measurement-only successor, kept per-stream EWMAs of frame-unit bytes
vs. emitted body bytes and published `share_base`/`excess_base`/
`excess_enh` into `run_bitrate_policy`'s blended target; it was deleted
on 2026-09-01 when that blend became a fixed per-rung formula, because
every bitrate write it provoked cost a keyframe (see
`docs/airtime-model.md` §1). `run_bitrate_policy` is once again a pure
function of the operating point: a held rung commands a held bitrate,
and (since 2026-09-03) so does a held rung *under probe* — the enh
probe slot's candidate mcs is deliberately excluded from the bitrate
formula (`docs/airtime-model.md`), so a probe costs zero encoder writes
and zero IDRs; the probe changes MCS only, as the 2026-08-05 spec says.

The drone's `:8301` `ov_base_pct`/`ov_enh_pct` HTTP override (bench
tooling, not a production control) is now the ONLY source of
commanded-vs-applied divergence: with no override armed, applied always
equals commanded. `tools/maburtop.py`'s DRONE and LADDER panels reflect
this (`_ov_cmd_cell`/`_ov_applied_cell`) — a mismatch there means an
armed override or a stale/old-daemon snapshot, not a balancer at work.

Measurement basis for the same-rate decision: ten static operating
points plus a motion sweep, `docs/same-rate-uep-findings-2026-08-30.md`.

Everywhere below that still says "s1" or "s3" is pre-2026-08-29
vocabulary for what is now sid0 (BASE) and sid1 (ENH — still the
probe/canary layer the ladder attributes demotes to). The demote-input
names, the surviving config key `s3_settle_ms`, and ctl-log reason
strings (`s3_residual`, `s3_util`) were kept as-is rather than renamed
(see `gs/src/ctl_log.h`'s ctllog 7 note) — read every s1/s3 mention past
this point as sid0/sid1. (`s3_residual_confirm_ms` itself is gone, but
that removal predates this change — see the pooled-RF note below.)
⚠ SUPERSEDED 2026-09-04: sid1 (ENH) never changes MCS any more. The probe stream (below) carries the
candidate-MCS canary on its own SBI stream (id 5) now, so "sid1 — still
the probe/canary layer" is accurate only for recordings dated before
2026-09-04; from this date sid1 always rides the op MCS and every
mention of "the enh layer diverting to a candidate rate" in older
material is historical.

## RCF slotting into the inter-AU idle (2026-09-03)

Every GS control-frame send (RCF, DISC keepalive) blasts the
sibling RX card at ~−4 dBm and deafens the TX card, so a drone PPDU whose
preamble starts within ~180 µs of the send is lost on BOTH cards — one
whole aggregate per hit, the source of the bench's ~0.35 %/PPDU loss and
the 34 ms tail-repair stalls (`docs/gs-uplink-self-blanking-findings-2026-09-02.md`).
The chip already holds the TX until the PPDU it is receiving ends; what
kills is the NEXT PPDU starting right behind the blast, i.e. sends inside
an AU burst.

`RcfSlotter` (`gs/src/rcf_slot.h`) sits between `VrxController` and
`send_control`: while video flows, a control frame waits for an AU
completion at which the send will be on air before the next AU's burst is
due — predicted from the first-body arrival cadence (`t_first` of
consecutive AUs is flat to <1 ms; completion is not, it moves with frame
size and FEC repair). Completions too close to the next burst are skipped;
a frame offered within 2 ms after a good completion goes out at once; a
hold longer than `link.rcf_slot_hold_ms` (default 30, 0 = off) is released
anyway. With no AU in the last 100 ms (rendezvous, stalled video)
everything passes through, which is why DISC needs no bypass.

Bench A/B (mcs5 park, 11 Mb/s, agg 6, 100 s windows, gap-log instrument):

| | real losses/s | frames lost/s | RCF rx at drone | `close_ms` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| slotter off | 1.03 | 3.9 | 18.5/s | 5 |
| slotter on | 0.11 | 0.4 | 19.4/s | 22 |

Sends: 88 % released by an AU completion (hold p50 6 ms, p90 17 ms), 12 %
in-grace immediate, 0.5 % hold-timeout. Cost: a commanded op change now
reaches the drone up to one AU period later (`link.attrib.close_ms`
5 → 22 ms). Player `fec` p99 ≥ 20 ms windows: 31/90 → 7/100.
Sideport counters: `link.rcf_slot.{au,probe,timeout,passthru,tail_ub_ms}`.

**Probe-arrival release (2026-09-05).** While a probe is commanded, the
probe body is the last PPDU of every ENH burst and it lands 0.9 ms p50 /
4 ms p99 *after* the completion stamp (bench, probelog 2 `first_ms` vs
`t_complete`); a send's USB+chip latency is 1–1.5 ms, so a release at the
ENH completion put the blast exactly on the probe — the probe lost ~2.5×
the enh stream's own symbol loss, 45 of 55 lost probes had a GS send
inside the collision window (22 % baseline), and a fixed one-body tail
(`bee51c6`) was a measured null. An ENH completion now releases nothing
itself: the probe sink's `on_probe_tail` is the release
(`SlotReason::Probe`), with the idle-ahead check made at that instant.
A lost probe falls back to a deadline at completion + `tail_ub_ms`, a
decaying max of the observed completion→probe offsets floored at the
probe body's airtime, +1 ms. Base-AU completions release at once as
before (no probe trails a base burst). Interleaved A/B, pinned mcs4 /
probe mcs4 / `feedback_ms` 50, 8 min arms:
`docs/probe-blanking-fix-findings-2026-09-05.md` — probe loss 0.21 % →
0.06 %, below the enh stream's 0.08 %, enh unchanged.

## Probe stream (2026-09-04) — current promote gate

Replaces the s3 probe-before-promote design entirely (the 2026-08-05
paragraphs below are marked superseded). RC_VERSION 5 → 6. Spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-probe-stream-design.md`.

**What it is.** The drone appends one extra body — SBI stream id 5
(`kProbeStreamId`, `common/include/mabur/probe_wire.h`), exactly one
video-body length (1405 B at the shipped 332/bpb4 geometry since SBI
header ver 2 (`air_ms`, 2026-09-06; was 1403 B on the 11-byte ver-1
header),
`13 + bpb*(2 + kSwHeaderLen + symbol_size)`, derived from the same
`FecCfg` as video and never independently configured) — after every
video access unit, base and enh alike (since 2026-09-16, see "Probe per
AU" below; enh-only before), all the time the link is LINKED. It flies at the profile of
rung `current + link.probe.rung_offset` (default 1), commanded fresh on
every RCF (`Rcf::probe_profile`, 0xFF = no probe: disabled, or already
on the top rung). Every sub-block repeats a 9-byte header (magic, seq,
profile, `enh_fid`) so a body with one surviving block is still
attributed rather than booked as `bpb` lost blocks. An FCS-failed probe
PPDU still reaches `ProbeTrack`: `Aggregator::on_rx_body` routes every
probe body to the sink regardless of `crc_ok`, and `parse_probe_body`
salvages the CRC-clean sub-blocks exactly as the video decoder does for
an FCS-corrupt video body — gating the probe sink on `crc_ok` would book
every FCS-failing PPDU as a full `bpb`-block loss instead of just its
dead sub-blocks, biasing the gate ~4x pessimistic toward Lossy.

**The enh tail and the GS uplink blast (corrected 2026-09-05).** The
2026-09-04 design assumed a send released at the ENH completion is on
air ≥ `lead_ms` (3 ms) later, long after the probe. Measured: the probe
lands 0.9 ms p50 / 4 ms p99 after the completion stamp and the send's
real USB+chip latency is 1–1.5 ms, so the slotter aimed the blast at the
probe (~2.5× the enh stream's own loss, GS-inflicted, vanishing at
`feedback_ms` 200). Fixed by releasing on the probe's arrival instead —
"RCF slotting" above, `docs/probe-blanking-fix-findings-2026-09-05.md`.
A probe sent at a random time would land inside the ~180 µs blast
~0.35 %/PPDU of the time; with the probe-arrival release it is the one
PPDU the slotter can never hit, and on the bench it now loses *less*
than the enh stream it predicts.

**Scoring rule — union across cards, AU count for expected, never seq
gaps.** `ProbeTrack` (`gs/src/probe_track.h`) books one expectation of
`bpb` blocks per ENH AU that begins — NOT from probe sequence numbers.
A wholly-lost probe stream carries its `seq` counter inside the lost
bodies, so scoring "expected" from arrival-side seq gaps could never
book an expectation for a 100 %-lost interval; it would read as silence
(no data, ladder ignores it) instead of loss (data, score it zero) —
exactly the case this gate exists to catch. Counters (`expected_blocks`,
`arrived_blocks`, `bodies_rx`) are kept for the COMMANDED profile only,
plus a single monotonic `off_profile` count for bodies that finalize
carrying a different profile (the RCF-lag tail, ~20-65 ms after a rung
change) — those bodies are "not scored", not "lost". `arrived_blocks` is
the union (OR of survivor bitmaps) across GS radio cards, because that
is what video gets through the two-card FEC dedup — scoring anything
else would not predict what a promote actually delivers. Every counter
is strictly non-decreasing: an off-profile body cancels its OWN enh AU's
still-pending expectation (keyed by the AU's frame id, the same id the
probe body carries as `enh_fid`) rather than an "un-book" of an already
counted total — there is no subtraction path. Per-card cumulative
counters exist alongside the union purely for the "which card collapsed
at range" question (flight-0016).

⚠ 2026-09-04 bench finding: a delivered body's AU used to finalize on
its own timer, ~5-30 ms before the body's own finalize instant, so a
one-body `expected` deficit sat open between the two and the 500 ms
`S1LossWindow` (sampled every 50 ms) read a fraction of samples as a
phantom `probe_u` 0.2 quantum against a real per-body loss of ~0.2 %.
Fixed by tying a matched AU's finalize to its body's: a still-pending
AU is matched to its body on the body's first sight and now finalizes
in the same `tick()` as the body, so only a genuinely lost probe ever
opens a gap.

**Gate table (spec §4.4).** Every existing promote condition stays
(`u < up_util` sustained `clean_ms`, `hold_after_down_ms`,
`min_between_changes_ms`, next rung exists and unpenalized); the probe
gate is consulted on top, only once a probe is commanded:

| gate | action |
|---|---|
| Clean, streak ≥ `probe.clean_bodies` (bodies, since 2026-09-16; was `clean_ms`) | promote now; probation as today; `++promotes_probed`; reason `promote_probed` |
| Clean, streak short | wait — the promote lands the tick the streak reaches `clean_bodies` |
| Lossy | **hold**, no penalty (nothing was tried, the probe keeps measuring for free); `++probe_holds` once per hold episode |
| NoInfo | **hold**, same counter — a commanded-but-absent probe (enh shed, drone not sending) is precisely the blind promote this design exists to prevent |

`promote_probed` vs plain `promote`: the legacy direct promote (reason
`promote`) survives ONLY when no probe is commanded at all
(`link.probe.enable: false`, or already on the top rung, which cannot
promote anyway). Demotes always win and are untouched — there is no
probe state to abort, since there is no probe state machine any more.

`u_probe` is scored against the CANDIDATE rung's own enh budget
(`budget_enh_for(idx + 1)`) — the tighter of the base/enh pair under the
base ≥ enh operator rule — never the current rung's. `RungStore::
observe_probe()` labels the sample by the PROBED rung, so
`link.rungs[].probe_u` at rung r means "loss measured at r, scored
against r's own enh budget" at the default `rung_offset` — with
`rung_offset > 1` the sample is scored against the budget of
`r − rung_offset + 1` instead, which is the extra margin the knob buys.

**v2 hook.** The gate state at `rung_offset 1` is a leading indicator
for demotes but does not drive one yet — the design's §10 keeps
probe-driven demote explicitly out of scope. `flightreport.py`'s
probe-lead report (`docs/observability.md`) is the input a v2 threshold
would be tuned against.
First flights 2026-09-05: `docs/probe-stream-flight-findings-2026-09-05.md`
— the gate's loss quantum is 0.2 per lost body, so `max_util` must sit
below 0.2 (0.15 flown: rung-5 median hold 16 s vs 1 s at 0.2).

### Probe per AU (2026-09-16) — 60 probes/s, streak in bodies

**Why.** The gate is a zero-loss run test: a streak of n bodies passes
with probability (1−p)^n at candidate-rung PPDU loss p, so its resolution
is a body count. The 2026-09-06 flights held 90 bodies (3 s at 30/s) and
18 % of probed promotes still failed inside 2 s, all after a 90/90-clean
streak — 90 bodies can only reject ≈3.3 % PPDU loss at 95 % (rule of
three) and rung 5 fails below 1 %. The goal here is not more resolution
but the SAME resolution in half the wall time: the promote latency is
bounded by `probe.clean_bodies` and `link.clean_ms` together (block 6
requires both streaks), so both came down.

**What changed.**
- The drone trails EVERY video AU with a probe, base and enh
  (`probe_follows()` in `drone/src/probe_source.h`: any video sid while a
  probe is commanded, never a shed layer's AU). 60 fps SVC-T ⇒ 60
  probes/s; 30 fps ⇒ 30/s; enh shed ⇒ base still probes, so the gate no
  longer drops to NoInfo whenever the enh layer is absent (30 fps with
  SVC-T off used to mean no probe at all, and NoInfo holds every promote).
- `ProbeTrack::on_au(sid, fid)` books one expectation per video AU
  (`sid < UepEncoder::kNumStreams`); base and enh share one frame-id
  counter, so the off-profile cancel path is unchanged.
- The RcfSlotter treats a base completion like an enh one while a probe is
  commanded (`probe_follows = true`): the release is the probe's arrival,
  or the learned tail deadline if it is lost. Releasing at the base
  completion would put the RCF blast exactly on the base-tail probe — the
  2.5× GS-inflicted probe loss of 2026-09-04 again.
- `link.probe.clean_ms` → `link.probe.clean_bodies` (default 90; the old
  key fails boot). `LinkHealth::probe_bodies_total` (ProbeTrack union
  `expected_blocks / bpb`) feeds `ProbeGate::streak_bodies`, counted from
  the streak's first Clean sample. Sideport `link.probe.streak_bodies`
  replaces `streak_ms`; maburtop prints `54b`.
- The loss quantum halves: one lost body over the 500 ms window is
  1/30 / 0.333 = **0.1** at 60/s (0.2 at 30/s). `max_util` 0.15 → **0.05**
  in the bundle config so it still means "zero loss allowed" at any frame
  rate; 0.1–0.199 would now allow one loss, the setting flight 20 showed
  fails in ~1 s.
- Bundle config: `link.clean_ms` 3000 → 1500, `link.probe.clean_bodies`
  90, `link.probe.max_util` 0.05. Promote latency ≈ 1.5 s + RCF lag at
  60 fps, unchanged confidence.

**Costs.** Probe airtime doubles: ≈0.8 % of air at rung 4 (probe at mcs5),
≈2.8 % at rung 0 (probe at mcs1), where the budget already runs tight —
the bench "nil cost" of 2026-09-04 was measured at mcs5 only. Twice as
many bodies are in flight across each RCF lag, so `off_profile` per rung
change should read ~2–12, not 2–6. Mismatched pair: new drone + old GS
reads arrived > expected (loss clamps to 0, blind gate); old drone + new
GS reads 50 % loss and never promotes — deploy both ends together, no
wire bytes change. What this does NOT fix: the probe is one short PPDU
while video flies as agg6 aggregates ~6× longer on air, so it
underestimates per-aggregate loss; that bias is the remaining fast-fail
lever (SNR floor at the candidate rung, or `rung_offset 2`).

**Bench 2026-09-16 (deployed both ends, commit 61f19e7).** Session
`/media/dvr/log/0104` (the ctl.log's second `ctllog` header is the new
pair; the first two climbs in that file are the boot-time old binaries —
both boards had been power-cycled ~10 min before the deploy).
- Cold climb 0→5, all `promote_probed`, **1.85 s/rung** (was ~3.1–3.5):
  `noinfo` at the rung change, `clean` at +0.30–0.36 s, promote +1.5 s
  later = 90 bodies at 60/s. Repeated on a second adaptive restart.
- `ausniff` 60.5 fps, 0 fid gaps, 908/908 (twice); `aucadence` +2.78 ms
  (inside the 2.4–2.9 band).
- Pinned mcs4 / probe mcs4, 254 s, 15 255 probe bodies at **59.9/s**
  (7628 base-tail, 7627 enh-tail, joined to au.log by fid): probe body
  loss **0.052 % on base tails, 0.066 % on enh tails**, no partial
  bodies, vs the enh stream's own 0.17 % symbol loss — the base-tail
  probe is not blasted by the RCF slotter.
- `off_profile` 10 over one 5-rung climb (2/change, inside 2–12).
- Rung-0 air: pinned mcs0 with the probe at mcs1 (60/s) vs no probe —
  drone `air_backlog_max_ms` ≤ 6, `air_shed` never, `txq` depth ≤ 2.
  ⚠ The sideport `link.air_pct` (60.1 vs 60.4 %, n 100 each) sums only
  streams 0/1, so it cannot see the probe's share; analytically the
  probe costs ≈ 60 × 0.91 ms = **5.5 % of air at rung 0** (2.7 % before),
  ≈ 1.6 % at rung 4.

## Drone congestion shed (2026-09-03)

The GS ladder never consumes drone telemetry (`T_TELEM` is display-only,
`gs/src/main.cpp`); every demote input is measured on the GS from the
video it receives. So a body the drone's TxQueue throws away before it is
ever sent looks exactly like an RF loss — expected symbol, never arrived,
abandoned at the horizon — and the ladder demotes for it. flight-0011
showed the loop: an encoder scene burst over its command (17–22 Mb/s vs
16) filled the queue to its cap at 36 dB SNR, drop-oldest booked ~330
drops, the GS scored them as residual and stepped 5→4→3→2 in 450 ms
with an IDR on every step into a queue that was already full. All 722
TxQueue drops of that flight sat in three such events.

The fix is drone-side and instant: `RcAgent::run_congestion_guard` now
sheds the enh layer when the TxQueue is at or past **half its cap**
(level-triggered, sampled on the 100 ms tick, via `RadioHealth::
txq_depth`/`txq_cap`), in addition to its original USB-failure trigger.
A shed is applied at the UEP encoder before anything is queued — no
frame id, no expected symbol — so the GS sees enh silence, which
`s3_usable()` treats as "no information", not loss. Recovery is the
existing 2 s-clean step-down per level. `txq.drops` stays a telemetry
counter: by the time it moves the damage is done, and at 1 Hz it would
reach the GS after the cascade anyway. The remaining half of the problem
— why the encoder overshoots its command by up to 40 % — is a venc
rate-control question, not a ladder one.

## Drone air clock (2026-09-06)

The post-demote latency spike (`docs/probe-stream-flight-findings-2026-09-05.md`
§9) is a drain: 2–3 IDRs plus the encoder still producing the OLD rung's
bitrate for ~0.4–1 s after the RCF dropped the MCS, served at the new,
lower rate. The backlog sits past the TxQueue pop, where the congestion
shed above cannot see it. The drone now models it directly
(`drone/src/air_clock.h`, spec `2026-09-06-air-clock-enh-shed-design.md`):
every body pushed to the TxQueue books `bytes × 8 / (phy_rate(layer) ×
air_clock.efficiency_<bw>[mcs]) + air_clock.body_us` on a virtual air clock
(`efficiency` is a per-MCS table since 2026-09-17 — the bench-measured
delivered/nominal fraction, `drone/src/air_rate.h`, and `run_bitrate_policy`
prices off the same table, see `docs/airtime-model.md` §7), priced
at the APPLIED op's per-layer rate (re-priced on every AppliedOp, so the
clock drops to the new rate the instant a demote lands), leaky at zero.
`backlog = free_at − now` is read at every frame's arrival, stamped on the
AU's bodies (SBI `air_ms`) and, when `air_clock.shed_ms` > 0 and the
backlog is at/past it, the enh AU is dropped at `FramePipeline` before a
frame_id exists (no id gap; base and IDR are never dropped; the probe body
rides only after a shipped enh AU, so it goes too). `shed_ms` 0 — the
shipped default — is observe-only.

The gate in `frame_pipeline.cpp` runs before `drop_if_shed`, so when the
congestion shed and the air gate are both active on sid 1 the drop is
booked in `air_dropped()`, not `UepEncoder::dropped(1)` — maburtop's
`_shed_cell` shows `CONG` over `AIR` for the same reason. `air_shed_drops`
therefore equals ausniff's missing-enh count only while CONG is off; with
CONG also on, some of ausniff's missing enh bodies are attributed to the
congestion shed instead. The dry-run replay path (`main.cpp`'s
`run_dry_run` pump) calls `apply_op_to_uep` only, never
`apply_op_to_clock` — this is intentional, not a gap: dry-run does not
price the clock, so replayed bodies always carry `air_ms` 0 and the gate
never closes there.

Ladder-side this is the same contract as the congestion shed: enh
silence is `NoInfo` to `s3_usable()` and the probe gate, never loss; the
base `residual` path stays live. It ORs with, and never touches,
`failsafe_shed_` / `shed_level_`. `efficiency` and `body_us` are
calibration knobs, not derivations — `tools/bench/airdrain.py --model`
fits them against the player's measured air excess per frame
(Stage A of the spec) before the gate is armed (Stage B).

**Flown 2026-09-06, three flights
(`docs/air-clock-flight-findings-2026-09-06.md`).** The model is only
calibratable when the link has headroom: at `encoder.airtime_budget`
0.6 the bitrate policy's `rate/3` command plus uncounted framing puts
~70 % of nominal on air, which is 100 % of the model's capacity at
efficiency 0.7 — the clock ran at 0.9–0.95 utilisation, integrated
every burst and over-predicted ~2.5× with a knife-edge fit. **Budget
0.5 removed the post-demote drain at the source** (cascade peak 47 →
20 ms, settle 1.9 → 0.3 s, steady-state p99 ~10 ms every rung) and
brought the model to 0.74–0.81 utilisation, where it tracks the GS.
Flight-fitted efficiency is ~0.73 at rungs 1–4 (rung 0 still
over-priced). **Shipped production values: budget 0.5, `shed_ms` 25,
`efficiency` 0.73** — armed, the gate dropped 14 enh AUs in a 344 s
flight, all at transitions (demote drains and promote IDRs, a ~60 kB
IDR alone is ~25 ms at mcs3), zero phantoms, air tail clipped at 35 ms.
Do not arm it with the budget back at 0.6: there it becomes a
steady-state enh throttle. The remaining > 100 ms tails are FEC repair
waits at loss-driven demotes, not air.

## Tuning invariant

Tuning invariant: the controller's s3 loss/residual
windows are 500 ms wide, while the post-transition blanking
(`s3_settle_ms`, default 300) and probe settle (`probe_settle_ms`, 150)
are shorter — so up to ~200 ms of pre-transition symbols remain in view
after blanking expires. ⚠ SUPERSEDED 2026-09-04 — see "Probe stream"
above: `probe_settle_ms` and the discrete probe state machine it
blanked are DELETED (the key now FAILS BOOT); the probe stream is
always-on and has no settle blackout of its own to tune. The
`s3_settle_ms` half of this paragraph (the ENH/base rung-transition
blanking) is UNCHANGED and still governs real rung changes. Shipped
defaults are safe (stale weight decays
fast against the 250/500 ms confirm windows), but do NOT lower
`s3_settle_ms`/`s3_residual_confirm_ms` toward their floors together: a
rung transition's FEC re-key artifacts could then satisfy the s3-residual
confirm and self-demote on every promote. ⚠ 2026-09-05: that self-demote
DID happen, from the other direction — `s3_settle_ms` only gated the
controller's READ; the 500 ms `s3_resid_cur` window behind it was never
cleared at the edge (the base window got its 150 ms `blank_until` on
2026-09-02, the enh one did not), so the abandonment horizon's ~80 ms
late booking of old-rung loss re-fired an `s3_residual` demote the tick
the 300 ms gate opened, on a 0 ms confirm. Flights 20/21: 13 of 14
s3_residual cascades double-stepped at exactly 300–310 ms and were
promoted straight back ~3 s later. Fixed by `gs/src/transition_edge.h`,
which settle-blanks only the two RESIDUAL decision windows (base and
enh; pinned by `tests/test_transition_edge.cpp`) at every op edge. The
util windows (pre-FEC, base and enh) briefly joined the same blank later
that day (51dd79e), for the same reason: with only the residual windows
blanked the bench still took an `s3_util` step at +400 ms on stale loss,
because every demote opens the fade regime and in-regime the util
confirm is `fade.confirm_ms`, not the 250 ms the "util needs no blank"
paragraph above assumed. That util blank was itself reverted the same
day (2026-09-05) when the two util inputs moved to arrival-time booking
— see "**Since 2026-09-05 (arrival tracker, ctllog 11)…**" further down
this file: the ArrivalTracker never books old-rung loss against the new
rung, so its denominator does not collapse after a re-key and no blank
is needed there any more; `TransitionEdge` today blanks only the two
residual windows. `flightreport.py` prints an
"s3-settle-refire canary" that must read ~0 on any recording after this.
See `docs/probe-stream-flight-findings-2026-09-05.md` §9. ⚠ SUPERSEDED 2026-08-15 — see
the pooled-RF note below: `s3_residual_confirm_ms` is REMOVED and FAILS
BOOT, so there is no longer a config knob to lower — the s3-residual
confirm window this paragraph warns about is now permanently at 0 ms
(its floor), unconditionally, for every deployment. That is deliberately
NOT the unsafe floors-together configuration described here: it is safe
only because attribution is exact rather than fast (the watermark is in
symbol-sequence space, so debris is absent from the input rather than
outrun by a shorter window) — see the 2026-08-15 note for the residual
risk that distinction does not cover.

Since 2026-08-14 the ladder's demote inputs are transition-attributed
(kill switch `link.attrib`, default true. ⚠ SUPERSEDED 2026-08-15 — see
the pooled-RF note below: `link.attrib` is REMOVED and now FAILS BOOT,
attribution is unconditional, and this is no longer a kill switch):
per-stream watermarks — with
the RX PHY rate as the generation boundary — split every loss counter
into current-rung vs pre-transition debris, and all four demote inputs
(instant s1 residual, s3 residual, both utils) read the current-only
side, so a rung change's own FEC debris can no longer fire a follow-up
demote. The sideport reports `link.streams[].abandoned_stale`; the ctl log
went `ctllog 1` → `ctllog 2` (S line gained `resid_cur`; `resid` stays the
total). ⚠ It also reported `link.attrib.suppressed` until 2026-09-02, when
that counter was deleted along with the packet-level delivery window it was
defined against — it counted windows where the packet total and attributed
views disagreed, which the symbol-based measure cannot ask.
`flightreport.py` parses every version. Date recordings against this
line: pre-2026-08-14
residual/util figures include transition debris that later recordings
attribute away. `link.attrib: false` reverts the decisions (not the
bookkeeping) to the old totals. ⚠ SUPERSEDED 2026-08-15 — see the
pooled-RF note below: `link.attrib` no longer exists, so this revert path
is gone too — the config key FAILS BOOT and the only way back to
pre-attribution decisions is a binary rollback.

**Since 2026-08-14 (same day, second wave) demotes are fade-aware.** Two
independent pieces, both default-on, both killable, and the whole
`link.fade` block is optional with working defaults. Every loss-driven
demote — residual, s3 residual, s3 util, confirmed util, and a fade
demote itself, but NOT probation, starved or timeout — arms a 2.5 s fade
regime (`hold_ms`), and arms it UNCONDITIONALLY so that the exported
regime state stays truthful. `link.fade.cascade` gates only the effect:
while the regime is open and the cascade is on, the demote confirm
windows drop 250/500 ms to 100 ms (`confirm_ms`), so a real fade steps
down at fade speed rather than at steady-state speed. Kill the cascade
and the regime is still armed and still reported — it just stops
shortening anything. ⚠ SUPERSEDED 2026-08-15 — see the pooled-RF note
below: `link.attrib` is gone and so is this gate. The paragraph below
describes 2026-08-14 second-wave behaviour only; since 2026-08-15 the s3
residual path has no confirm window to gate at all (it demotes instantly,
unconditionally), and the s3 util confirm — the only one left — always
runs at `in_fade_regime(now_ms) ? fade.confirm_ms : confirm_ms`, with no
attrib-off branch. Both s3 confirms were additionally gated on
`link.attrib`: with attribution OFF the regime kept the full
`s3_residual_confirm_ms` / `confirm_ms` there, because a 100 ms confirm
behind the unshortened 300 ms `s3_settle_ms` is exactly the
floors-together configuration the tuning invariant above forbids — the
~200 ms of debris that outlives the blank satisfies 100 ms and not the
legacy window. Measured in review, a single genuine demote then cascaded
rung 4 → 0 in 1.6 s on nothing but its own FEC debris. So `attrib: false`
used to revert Part A's s3 paths along with everything else. (The s1 util
confirm is NOT gated: it has no blanking at all, so its legacy 250 ms
window already sits inside the same 500 ms loss window the debris
occupies — amplitude decides it there, not duration.)

`link.fade.predict` adds an RF trigger ahead of any loss: both `rssi_db`
(8 dB) AND `snr_db` (4 dB) below their slow baselines, sustained
`trigger_ms` (300 ms), demotes one rung with reason `fade`. Those
baselines are a dual-timescale EWMA — fast tau 300 ms, slow tau
asymmetric at 2 s rising / 20 s falling; structural constants, not config
— so a multi-second fade cannot drag its own baseline down and erase its
own delta. ⚠ **Those two numbers are thresholds on a high-pass response,
not fade depths, so they are NOT trip points.** A step of depth D reaches
`delta = D·(e^−t/20000 − e^−t/300)`, which peaks at 0.92·D at 1.28 s and
is down to 0.74·D by 6 s, so the smallest step that fires is ≈1.08× the
configured number: `rssi_db: 8.0` trips on a ≈8.7 dB fade, `snr_db: 4.0`
on a ≈4.3 dB one, and a fade of exactly 8/4 dB never fires. A fade that
stops descending falls back under threshold as the baseline catches up
(this detects fading, not faded), and on a steady ramp the response is
slope-driven — ~19.7 dB of delta per dB/s — so ramps under ~0.45 dB/s
never reach `rssi_db` 8 however deep they eventually get. `trigger_ms` is
not the binding constraint either: the delta needs ~0.8–1.3 s to climb to
its peak, so the 300 ms fast tau sets the reaction time. Those are
harness/model figures (they reproduce the review's measured deltas
exactly) — and the defaults are deliberately unchanged, since tightening
them without bench data is what the spec's tuning invariant forbids.
**First flight validation, 2026-08-14 (flight-0017/0018 + ctl-0054/0055,
two ~6 min flights):** exactly the predicted behavior. 26 loss-driven
demote episodes, all ramp-type range fades; the predictive trigger
correctly never fired (deepest deltas drssi −7.8 / dsnr −4.4, never
jointly over threshold — slope-blind on ramps as the transfer function
says), zero false fades, zero attribution-miss canary hits, in-regime
cascades stepping multi-rung episodes at ~410–440 ms, and zero
mid-flight video-damage windows. A genuine FAST fade (obstruction,
multipath null) has still never been recorded against this trigger. Three things to know before reading any of it: (i) the
predictive trigger is LATCHED — exactly ONE predictive demote per fade
EVENT, and the latch releases only on an *observed* recovery, a tick where
both deltas are measurably back under threshold. A NaN window (absent
evidence) deliberately does NOT release it, so further steps during a
continuing fade are the cascade's job, on measured loss at the shortened
in-regime confirms; `link.ctl.counters.demotes_fade` therefore counts fade
events that produced a step, not rungs lost to fade. (ii)
`link.fade.min_rung` (default 2) is the lowest rung the trigger fires
FROM, not a floor — the effective floor is `min_rung - 1`, so the shipped
default can land the link on rung 1. (iii) fade demotes are RF evidence,
not rung evidence: they never book a probation failure or a penalty and
never count in the RungStore's `exits_bad`.

Observability for that wave: the sideport adds `link.ctl.fade` = {active,
drssi, dsnr} plus `counters.demotes_fade` (additive under `v: 1`;
drssi/dsnr serialize as `null` when NaN). `fade.active` is the RAW regime
state and is deliberately NOT gated on `cascade`, so the regime stays
visible with the cascade killed. The ctl log went `ctllog 2` → `ctllog 3`,
the S line gaining `drssi dsnr` after `resid_cur`; `flightreport.py`
parses v1, v2 and v3 and gained an episode analyzer (`find_episodes()`,
`print_episode_report()`): first-demote reason per episode, fade lead
times, false fades with time-to-repromote, plus an attribution-miss canary
(`attribution_misses()` — a `residual` demote within 200 ms of any
previous transition, which should be ~zero with `link.attrib` on). The
jsonl branch also prints the flight-wide `link.attrib.suppressed` delta for
recordings old enough to carry that key (removed 2026-09-02).
⚠ The s1 RF labels are now freshness-gated per card
(`gs/src/rf_labels.h`, `select_label_card()`, unit-tested in
`tests/test_rf_labels.cpp`): the best-card argmax only considers cards
whose s1 frame count advanced in the current feedback window, so
`s1_snr_db`, `s1_evm_db` and `s1_rssi_dbm` read NaN — and the ctl log
prints `nan` — whenever no card measured s1 that window, where a frozen
EMA previously printed a stale-but-present number. Because `s1_evm_db`
now NaNs on stale windows, per-rung EVM sample counts in the RungStore
drop on a marginal link: that is a deliberate honesty improvement, but it
means EVM sample counts are NOT comparable across this date.

**The expected false-fade source is a label-source card hop, and it is
what to look for when a `fade` demote has no fade behind it.** That
argmax does not stick: a front-end that wedges for ~1 s (a documented,
recovering failure mode on the two-card bench GS) hands the labels to a
weaker sibling, and `s1_rssi_dbm`/`s1_snr_db` then step down TOGETHER —
bit for bit the trigger's joint condition, so a ≥9 dB RSSI / ≥4.3 dB SNR
gap between cards is a spurious `fade`. ⚠ SUPERSEDED 2026-08-15 — see the
pooled-RF note below: the defence described in the rest of this paragraph
is DELETED, not merely inactive. The operational guidance (how to
recognise and correlate a card-hop false fade) below is unchanged and, if
anything, matters more now, because this branch makes a hop-driven false
fade possible for the first time — read it as "what to look for", not
"why it can't happen". ~~The controller defends itself: the selected card
index rides along in `LinkHealth` and a change re-baselines both EWMAs
(so a hop reads as a new reference, not a fade), at the cost of making a
fade already in progress re-accumulate its delta on the new card —
conservative in the direction everything else here is.~~ The latch is
deliberately NOT released by a hop. If a false fade shows up anyway,
correlate the ctl log's `drssi`/`dsnr` step against per-card
`classes.s1.*` in the sideport: a hop moves both by the card GAP in one
window, a real fade moves them along the transfer function above.

**Since 2026-08-15 the RF labels are s1+s3 pooled, the card-hop
re-baseline is gone, attribution is unconditional, and s3 residual
demotes instantly.** Four coupled changes, spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-pooled-rf-and-instant-s3-design.md`.
(i) `s1_snr_db`/`s1_evm_db`/`s1_rssi_dbm` became `rf_*` and are sourced
from a new per-card s1+s3 pooled track (97% of frames at one PHY rate);
`msp`/`ctrl` are excluded because per-rate TX power makes their
contribution depend on a mix ratio that drifts with rung and shed state.
⚠ This is a second discontinuity in RungStore's per-rung EVM baselines,
on top of the 2026-08-14 freshness gate — EVM sample populations are NOT
comparable across either date. ⚠ The jsonl sideport carries no version
marker at all (the ctl log's header bump doesn't reach it): the same
pooled-track change silently flips the meaning of
`link.ctl.last_event.snr`/`.evm` and `link.ctl.last_probe.snr`/`.evm` from
s1-only to s1+s3 pooled, with nothing in the jsonl itself to say so — date
any jsonl recording against 2026-08-15 the same way you would a ctl log's
`ctllog` header. (ii) The card-hop EWMA re-baseline is
deleted: it was zeroing `drssi`/`dsnr` on 25% of ticks (372 of 1483
across flight-0017/0018), so **every fade delta recorded before this date
is suppressed and must not be pooled with later ones** — the trigger
could not fire regardless of fade depth, which is a second explanation
for its silence alongside ramp slope-blindness. Its premise was also
wrong: the argmax runs on SNR, so the SNR label is `max(snr)` over live
cards and is continuous across a hop; only RSSI stepped, and measured hop
steps were indistinguishable from ordinary variation. (iii) `link.attrib`
is REMOVED and now FAILS BOOT; attribution is unconditional and there is
no config rollback, only a binary one. `residual_cur` / `close_ms` remain
on the sideport (`suppressed` was removed later, 2026-09-02), but
`link.attrib.on` is REMOVED — a `v: 1` schema removal in the same class as the 2026-08-12
`offset_qdb` removals, with `maburtop.py` updated in the same wave.
(iv) `link.s3_residual_confirm_ms` is REMOVED and FAILS BOOT: s3 residual
now demotes on the first window, exempt from `min_between_changes_ms`,
like s1's. That is safe only because attribution is EXACT rather than
fast for debris the transition watermark actually classifies as stale —
the watermark is in symbol-sequence space, so that debris is absent from
the input rather than outrun — and `s3_settle_ms` blanking is retained.
⚠ That does NOT cover every pre-transition case: genuine current-rung s3
abandonment that was correctly attributed to the OLD rung can still sit
inside `s3_residual_loss`'s underlying 500 ms sliding window (never
cleared at a transition, only blanked from the decision) and fire a
follow-up instant demote at the tick `s3_settle_ms` expires — pre-existing
behaviour, bounded to ~2 firings, not something this branch changed but
worth knowing when reading `demotes_s3_residual`. Predicted cost ~4× that
path's demote rate (~19 events per two 6-minute flights vs the 5
observed); materially above that on the first flight has two candidate
causes that want different responses — the estimate's 500 ms sampling
hiding back-to-back firing (confirm window returns in reduced form), or
the sliding-window mechanism just described (bound/blank the window at a
transition instead). Count s3-residual demotes landing within roughly
`s3_settle_ms` + one tick of a PREVIOUS transition separately to tell
them apart; `flightreport.py`'s `find_episodes()` already has the
machinery. The ctl log went
`ctllog 3` → `4` (formats byte-identical, meanings changed);
`flightreport.py` parses v1–v4 and warns on pre-v4. Deploy is GS-only and
config-before-binary: `grep -nE '"(attrib|s3_residual_confirm_ms)"'
/etc/maburgs.toml` and delete any hit before starting the new binary,
or maburgs crash-loops at 2 s. **Also swap `tools/maburtop.py` in the same
step, not as an afterthought:** an old maburtop against a new maburgs
renders the now-absent `link.attrib.on` as `attrib:OFF` — indistinguishable
from a real problem, and exactly the kind of thing that sends someone
hunting for a switch (`link.attrib`) that no longer exists and would fail
boot if they tried to set it. Deploy maburtop alongside the binary, not
after. Rollback for this wave happens to be binary-only: both `attrib`
and `s3_residual_confirm_ms` were optional with live defaults on the old
binary too, so the stripped config boots either way and there is nothing
to restore alongside the binary.

**Since 2026-09-02 (second wave, same day as ctllog 9) the s1 residual
demote input carries a 150 ms post-transition settle blank**
(`S1LossWindow::blank_until`, wired at `main.cpp`'s sid-0 transition
edge-detect next to `mark_transition`; the constant is `kResidSettleMs`,
not config). Root cause, from flight ctl-0160: the ctllog-9 rewrite fed
block 4 from a 500 ms sliding window over the cumulative abandonment
counters and deleted the old measure's per-step `reset_window()`, so loss
correctly booked as current-rung stayed `> 0` across the demote it caused
and — block 4 being instant, threshold-free and exempt from
`min_between_changes_ms` — re-fired every 50 ms tick until rung 0. Every
`first=residual` episode in that flight ran 4-5 rungs to the floor, one
at 26-32 dB SNR; flightreport's attribution-miss canary read 14.
Attribution itself was innocent (it classifies at booking time; already-
booked current loss is never reclassified). The blank clears the window
at the transition AND swallows deltas booked during the settle — the
~80 ms abandonment-horizon lag books old-rung loss late, and an A-MPDU
burst can kill the in-flight old-rate tail ABOVE the watermark, which
books non-stale. 150 ms = one edge-detect tick + horizon lag + margin,
half of `s3_settle_ms`; the s1 UTIL path keeps its no-blank design
(amplitude decides it) and still carries a genuine sustained fade down at
in-regime speed. This is the same window-outlives-the-blank hazard the
s3 note above bounds with `s3_settle_ms` — s3's window is deliberately
NOT blanked here (its ~2-firing bound is documented, accepted behaviour).
Only the decision input is blanked: S-line `resid`/`resid_cur`, the
sideport and the RungStore observability all still see the loss.
Bench-validated 2026-09-02 (ctl-0165, loss-sim build): a 500 ms
eff=20/burst=4 s0 pulse = ONE residual demote + two measured-util steps
at ~155 ms, floor at rung 2, repromote — where ctl-0160's equivalent was
a 50 ms/rung drop to rung 0; sustained eff=15 still walks 5→0 (util,
150-320 ms/rung) and recovers; ausniff 60.0 fps / 0 gaps. Expect
`residual` E-line pairs closer than 150 ms never again; a demote storm
now shows `util` reasons and real per-rung `u`.

**Since 2026-09-05 (arrival tracker, ctllog 11) the two util inputs are
booked at arrival time**, not from the decoder's completion counters:
`SwDecoder` owns a `mabur::ArrivalTracker` that books every source seq
once when it crosses a settle line 32 seqs behind the newest seq seen
(expected = sequence advance, arrived = heard; a repair's window end
advances the expectation), splitting both into stale/current with the
same watermark boundary abandonment uses. `main.cpp` feeds
`s1_loss_cur`/`s3_loss_cur` from the current-only side. Two things
follow. (1) The util blank added the same day (51dd79e) is REMOVED —
`TransitionEdge` blanks only the two residual windows — because the
tracker never books old-rung loss against the new rung and its
denominator does not collapse after a re-key. (2) The post-promote
`probation` bounce class (flight-0023: u = 1.0/0.8 on the first
post-blank tick; bench ctl-0299: 1.125) cannot occur: the offending
sample was a ~60 ms bucket with near-zero completions. What did NOT
change: the residual inputs (abandonment + 150 ms `kResidSettleMs`), the
thresholds, the budgets (`u` is still source-symbol loss over the parity
fraction). Bench and flight numbers before this line are
completion-booked (`docs/data-provenance.md`).
**Bench-validated ctl-0305..0339, deployed to the GS 2026-09-05**
(rollback `maburgs.pre-arrival`, the `ctllog 10` completion-booked build;
no config change); campaign-1 sweep inconclusive within bench noise — see
`docs/arrival-loss-findings-2026-09-05.md`. What passed: the pulse
campaign and the restart climbs — every demoting pulse `steps=1`, both
canaries 0, **no util sample above `down_util` within 200 ms of any
transition** now that the blank is gone, drone-switch p50 42 ms (control
57), 10/10 cold climbs reach rung 5 with `probation=0` — and the standing
gates on the deploy artifact (ausniff 60.0 fps / `fid_gaps=0` /
`incomplete={}`, aucadence offset 2.87 ms inside the 4.0 ms gate), plus
post-deploy ctl-0341 (clean 0→5, no `probation`, ausniff 1800 AUs /
`fid_gaps=0` / 60.0 fps). The steady-loss sweep decided nothing: on 200 ms
sideport buckets its run-to-run variance exceeds the control-candidate
difference (two runs of the same control binary disagree by 1.0 pp at
eff 20 %), so its accuracy criterion fails control-vs-control too; the one
repeatable per-step difference is a +0.7 pp over-read at eff 10 %, which
errs toward an earlier demote. The bench does not reproduce the probation
bounce this change targets (the control is `probation=0` on 10/10 too), so
the flight remains the real test.

Since 2026-10 (fec-nack) a symbol filled by a NACK retransmit counts as
abandoned for both residual paths and never reaches the arrival tracker:
the ladder sees the loss, only the video does not (`docs/fec-nack.md`).

**2026-10-06 (flight 0026, first NACK flight): the util decision windows
are CLEARED at a commanded op change again** (`gs/src/transition_edge.h`,
`s1_loss_cur`/`s3_loss_cur`, `blank_until(now)` with no swallow). The
adaptive blank below keeps post-edge old-rung bookings out of them, but
nothing emptied the 500 ms of old-rung loss legitimately booked before the
edge, and in the fade regime (100 ms confirm, 150 ms
`min_between_changes_ms`) one real demote kept re-deciding on it every
150 ms: in all four 5→0 cascades traced, `u` collapsed to 0 in ONE tick
exactly 500 ms after the booking that started the cascade, two or three
rungs below where the fade stopped, with SNR already back at 14–17 dB and
the re-promote 1.8 s later; 17 of the flight's 82 cascade steps rode on a
booking at least two steps old. That loss already produced its demote; the
new rung is judged on its own entries only. Cost: a genuine continuing fade
steps ~250 ms/rung (confirm on fresh entries) instead of 150. Bench gate
before flight: a fade-arm A/B on cascade depth and re-promote time.

The open-boundary path is itself an adaptive blank, not an absence of
one. While `SwDecoder`'s `wm_open_` is true, `arr_stale_end()` returns
`~0ull`, so every seq the tracker books during that time is stale and
the current-only side (`arr_expected − arr_expected_stale`) stays flat
— `s1_loss_cur`/`s3_loss_cur` receive no new entries until the boundary
closes on the first `kPost` body. Normally that lasts the drone's real
switch latency (bench: p50 42 ms, p90 65 ms), so the fixed 150 ms blank
this section describes for residual has effectively been replaced, on
the util side, by an adaptive blank scoped to the transition's true
length rather than a fixed guess. Degraded case: if `rx_mcs` is
`kMcsUnknown` no body ever carries `kPost`, and the boundary stays open
until `kBoundaryExpiryMs` (1000 ms, `common/src/uep_decoder.cpp`) —
during which the 500 ms util window empties, `s1_cur_sample.valid` goes
false and `gs/src/main.cpp` defaults `health.pre_fec_loss` to 0.0
(promote-permissive), and `link.pre_fec_loss` reads null. The ladder
reads a clean link (`u` = 0) for as long as this lasts, so
`clean_start` accrues through it. Watch `link.attrib_close_ms` (the
boundary close latency gauge) on a flight to see how long the adaptive
blank actually ran and whether it ever hit the 1 s worst case.

On the drone, RCF drain is decoupled from the agent tick
(`link.rc_drain_ms`, optional, default 5, bounds 1–1000): the agent loop
wakes every `rc_drain_ms` to drain queued RC frames, with ALL per-tick
housekeeping (USB health polls, `RcAgent::tick()`, watchdog, 1 Hz
stats/telem) behind a `TickGate` deadline so its cadence is bit-for-bit
unchanged, and `rc_drain_ms == tick_ms` reproduces the legacy loop
exactly. `link.tick_ms` is now bounded 1–1000 as well, and
`rc_drain_ms > tick_ms` FAILS BOOT (it would silently retime every
per-tick job to the drain period): the gate turned a bad `tick_ms` from
the old "spins at 100% CPU but works" into a ~1.8e19 ms period that fires
once at startup and never again — no failsafe, no rendezvous fallback, no
watchdog, no telemetry, nothing logged. Both bounds are new on
2026-08-14; note that a config setting `tick_ms` under 5 without also
setting `rc_drain_ms` now fails boot, since the default drain of 5 would
exceed it (nothing deployed does this). Op actuation used to be U(0, `tick_ms` = 100) ms, and
`link.attrib.close_ms` measured a ~110 ms median with tails at 295 and
971 ms. **Measured 2026-08-14 (follow-up session): the drain runs at 5 ms
on the device (verified via /proc thread wake rates), but close_ms median
is ~65 ms at n=24, not ≤30 — because 30–50% of uplink RCFs are lost to
the drone's own half-duplex TX airtime (CCA off at the time — ON again
since 2026-09-23, `docs/cca-on-findings-2026-09-23.md`; GS injects blind into
the drone's bursts; loss tracks `link.air_pct`, 51–59% delivery at climb
rungs 0–4, 69% parked). A lost commit-RCF costs one `feedback_ms` (50 ms)
quantum, so close_ms = an 11–28 ms fast path (Part C working, target met)
plus a geometric +50 ms ladder that Part C cannot touch. The ≤30 ms
acceptance criterion is unreachable without an uplink-delivery fix
(candidates, none built: repeat the RCF after an op change until
`drone.applied` echoes it; time injection into post-frame-burst gaps).
The same loss applies to ALL uplink control — probe RCFs, keepalive DISC,
IDR requests — and `feedback_ms` is effectively the uplink retry quantum.
Full analysis: `docs/rcf-uplink-loss-findings-2026-08-14.md`.** `link.fade`
and `link.rc_drain_ms` are optional with live defaults, so the new binary
runs against an untouched config on either device. Once either is
hand-tuned into `/etc/maburgs.toml` or `/etc/mabur.toml` — and the bench
GS is exactly the machine that will tune `link.fade.rssi_db` — that config
stops loading on an older binary (`unknown key` → the 2 s crash-loop
described further down). Write the key anyway when tuning wants it; that
is a rollback cost, and rolling forward is the answer. The former rule
that `bundle/mabur.default.toml` must NOT list `rc_drain_ms` was purely an
old-binary concession and no longer applies.



## RcAgent owns the encoder (venc fold-in, 2026-08-29)

The drone-side actuator used to be an HTTP client against `waybeam`. Since the
fold-in the encoder runs inside `maburd`, so `RcAgent`'s three verbs
(`set_bitrate_kbps`, `set_roi_qp`, `request_idr`) are direct calls into
`venc_core` on the agent thread. Nothing about the *policy* moved: the venc
core is a pure mechanism with zero encoder-local policy, and there is no
`venc.bitrate` config key — the commanded rate is only ever the output of
`run_bitrate_policy()`, i.e. `phy_rate(T0) × encoder.airtime_budget /
(1 + overhead)`, clamped to `encoder.bitrate_min_kbps`/`bitrate_max_kbps`.

What the fold-in did change:

- **Failed verbs are now visible and retried.** Each verb returns real status
  and RcAgent latches "what the encoder is running" only on success, so one
  dropped MI call is re-issued on the next policy tick instead of wedging the
  rate for the rest of the flight (that wedge was the old waybeam failure
  mode, and it is why the latch is conditional).
- **RcAgent is the only IDR authority, and it paces.** Every producer —
  GS-requested IDRs, the entering-LINKED heal, and the encoder's own
  chain-break signal — goes through one pacer: a 100 ms floor between any two
  IDRs, plus a 1 s holdoff between chain-break IDRs specifically. A refused
  request is DROPPED, not queued; the next real break re-raises it. The
  chain-break path is an atomic flag set from the venc callback and consumed
  at the top of `tick()`, evaluated against the state as of tick entry so a
  break that arrives on the same tick as a missed feedback deadline still
  heals. Dropping rather than deferring is affordable only because the
  encoder's GOP is the backstop: at the shipped `venc.gop_s = 2.0` an
  unhealed break self-clears within ~2 s, so raising `gop_s` stretches that
  safety net and the drop-vs-defer choice needs re-arguing. Measured on
  hardware 2026-08-29 under a deliberate ring-full storm (~24 drops/s): 0.596
  IDR/s, minimum observed spacing 919 ms — an unpaced path would have emitted
  roughly one IDR per drop.
  The one exception is a **GS-requested** IDR (RCF `idr_epoch`, RC_VERSION
  12, spec 2026-09-28): an epoch change raises a pending request that
  survives a pacer refusal and goes out on the first tick past the floor.
  The requester (the web GS page) is frozen and waiting on it, and its own
  retry is 300 ms, so dropping would turn a ≤100 ms wait into a 300 ms one.
  Session edges (DISC, unconfirmed move, FAILSAFE) clear it. When an RCF
  brings the link back from FAILSAFE/RENDEZVOUS, the entering-LINKED IDR
  also clears the pending GS request — FAILSAFE reset the seen epoch, so
  without this a redundant second IDR would otherwise follow 100 ms later.
  Served count: `RcAgent::idr_gs_total()` (on the wire as
  `drone.enc.idr_gs` until the 2026-09-30 telem diet).
- **The ring is now visible from both ends.** `drone.enc.venc_ring_fill_pct`
  and `drone.enc.venc_full_drops` report the PRODUCER side (the encoder
  discarding AUs because maburd had not drained), against the existing
  consumer-side `drone.enc.ring_drops`. (All three left the wire in the
  2026-09-30 telem diet.) See `docs/observability.md`.

### The bitrate policy pushes on CHANGE, plus a 5 s re-assert

`run_bitrate_policy()` only calls the encoder when its computed target
differs from the last value actually applied (decreases always go out
immediately; non-decreases are throttled to 1 Hz; state transitions force).

On top of that, `RcAgent::tick()` **re-asserts** the current computed target
every `RcAgent::kReassertMs` = **5000 ms**, with `force=true` (a `force=false`
re-assert would be a no-op by construction — an unchanged target is exactly
what the change gate suppresses). The clock runs from the last bitrate the
encoder actually *accepted*, so a link that keeps genuinely changing rung
never adds a re-assert on top of its own pushes; a parked one gets one every
5 s. The re-assert is gated to LINKED and FAILSAFE — RENDEZVOUS is the
pre-link state with nothing to defend the value against.

This closes two holes:

- **A failed verb in FAILSAFE is now retried.** `run_bitrate_policy()` latches
  its "last commanded" state only on a `true` return, so a failed apply is
  retried on the next policy run — but the only policy runs are on RCF, DISC
  and max-range entry. In FAILSAFE there are no RCFs by definition, so a verb
  that failed *on the failsafe entry itself* went unrepaired for up to
  `rendezvous_ms` (30 s) with the encoder flooding an mcs0-sized pipe at the
  previous rung's rate. A failed apply now short-circuits the interval and
  retries on the next tick.
- **Overrides are bounded.** Anything that moves the encoder rate behind
  RcAgent's back used to win until the ladder happened to change rung — the
  debug endpoint's `POST /venc/set?bitrate=` held for 20 s+ on a parked link
  in the 2026-08-29 bench run, and the same gap is the root of the historical
  waybeam-restart wedge (`docs/deploy.md`, rollback runbook). Such an override
  now survives **at most one re-assert interval (5 s)**. Bench procedures that
  relied on an override sticking need to re-POST inside that window.

### Encoder faults are process faults — there is no in-process rebuild

If the MI pipeline dies or has to be rebuilt (a resolution/sensor-mode change,
a wedged ISP), `maburd` must **exit and let `S96mabur` respawn it**.
`venc_core_stop()` + `venc_core_start()` in the same PID can never recover it,
and no amount of care in mabur's code changes that. Upstream implemented and
bench-tested every in-process reset lever on this SoC — disabling userspace
3A before VPE destroy, `MI_SYS_Exit`/`MI_SYS_Init` in-PID, closing the
`/dev/mi_vif` and `/dev/mi_vpe` fds, even `dlclose`/`dlopen` of the whole MI
vendor library set — and each one either wedges or comes back with a dead
stream (`ISP channel readiness timeout after 2000 ms` → `CmdLoadBinFile
failed -1` → `not sync err` floods → no frames). The residual state the
rebuild needs is per-task VIF/VPE/ISP channel state in the kernel driver,
released only by `execv`; userspace cannot reach it. Closed as a negative
result 2026-06-07 in `../waybeam_venc/documentation/STAR6E_SINGLE_PID_REINIT_FINDINGS.md`
— do not re-attempt without new SigmaStar SDK/kernel insight. In mabur this
is why fold-in bring-up failure is fatal-by-design (exit, respawn, cold
bring-up ~14–17 s measured, 5/5 unaided) rather than something the daemon
tries to heal in place.

### Low-power (disarmed) mode (2026-09-20)

While the FC reports DISARMED, `RcAgent` runs the encoder at
`low_power.bitrate_kbps` / `low_power.fps` (bundle: 1 Mb/s, 15 fps); an
ARMED report returns full power. The mode tracks the FC's **current** arm
state both ways — it is not a one-shot pre-arm latch — so a DISARMED report
re-enters it however many times the aircraft has armed before.
Spike: `docs/low-power-spike-findings-2026-09-19.md` (bitrate is the
thermal lever for SoC and radio alike, fps second-order, CPU clock not a
lever at all).

The second case this buys, after the pre-arm thermal one, is **recovery
video**: an aircraft that is down but still powered keeps answering
MSP_STATUS with DISARMED, so it drops back to the thin stream. At the mcs0
the ladder will have fallen to, 15 fps at 1 Mb/s is far likelier to reach
the GS than full rate — fewer FEC generations, more airtime budget per
frame. `armed_latched()` still records whether this process ever saw the FC
armed, which is what separates a pre-flight drone from a downed one on the
`stats:` line; it is observability only and deliberately does not gate the
mode.

- **Trigger.** The MSP thread polls `MSP_STATUS` (cmd 101) at 2 Hz on the
  OSD UART — the FC pushes only DisplayPort on its own — and hands BOXARM
  (flightModeFlags bit 0) to `RcAgent::note_arm_state()`, one atomic like
  the chain-break signal, consumed on the tick.
- **Fail open.** `low_power_active_` = enabled ∧ the last arm report says
  DISARMED ∧ that report is fresher than `low_power.stale_ms` (2 s).
  Silence, a dead UART, `msp.enable = false`: full power. A maburd respawn
  in flight boots full power and follows the first reply.
  Freshness is the whole safety property now that the arm latch no longer
  gates the mode: **a crash that kills the FC or its UART gives full-rate
  video, not this mode**, because the reports stop. Recovery video only
  works while the FC survives and keeps answering. The cost of dropping the
  latch is that a spurious DISARMED — an MSP desync, a corrupt frame whose
  XOR checksum happens to pass — throttles to 15 fps in flight until the
  next poll corrects it 500 ms later. Judged acceptable: a *real* in-flight
  disarm means the aircraft is already coming down. There is deliberately
  no debounce; one bad frame costs two rebinds and self-corrects.
- **What changes.** `run_bitrate_policy()` gains a target fps next to the
  target bitrate; the bitrate is additionally `min()`-clamped to the cap.
  fps goes out first, then the bitrate — its `SetChnAttr` IDR seeds the
  stream at the new rate, so the verb itself never requests one. Both
  follow the existing rules: latched on success only, retried on refusal
  (now in RENDEZVOUS too — on the ground there is no RCF to carry a
  retry), restated by the 5 s re-assert, so an fps set behind RcAgent's
  back is bounded like a bitrate override. Transitions run in any state.
- **The fps verb** (`venc_set_fps`, a port of waybeam f956a52 `apply_fps`)
  is a VPE→VENC unbind/rebind at `sensor_fps:fps` plus an RC `fpsNum` and
  GOP rewrite plus a SuperFrame re-derive. The RC `fpsNum` alone drops
  nothing: it is the CBR budget divisor, and writing 15 with the bind at
  60 measured 60 fps at 3.7x the commanded bitrate with the venc ring full
  (probe 2026-09-20). The rebind takes live in both directions on the
  running channel: 16.1 / 61.1 fps, 0 frame-id gaps, bitrate holding, one
  incomplete enh AU on the way down and none up. The verb logs
  `> FPS delivered N ... in M us`.
- **What the ladder does under the thin stream — measured on the bench,
  2026-09-20 (GS session 0147, drone log).** Three things, in the order
  they were found:
  1. **The probe gate held every promote for the whole pre-arm period.**
     The per-AU probe books 15 AU/s × bpb 4 = 30 expected symbols in the
     gate's 500 ms window (S lines read `probe_n` 28-32), and
     `link.probe.min_syms` was 40 — sized against 60 fps = 120 per window.
     Under the floor every sample is unusable, the gate reads NoInfo, and
     NoInfo *holds* the promote (spec §4.4). The first gate edge of the
     session is `P 9614278 1 clean … 115446`: 115 s of NoInfo from boot,
     ending the instant the FC armed and the stream went to 60 fps, after
     which the ladder climbed 0→5 in 8 s. **Fixed by lowering the floor
     to 16** (four AUs' worth — the true no-traffic floor; code default,
     `gs/bundle`, and the GS's `/etc/maburgs.toml`). With it the promote
     needs the same 90-body clean streak, which takes ~6 s at 15
     bodies/s instead of 1.5 s (`probe_gate_has_information_at_the_low_
     power_au_rate` pins both halves). Keep `min_syms` under
     `low_power.fps × 2` if either moves.
  2. **The thin stream makes the loss ratios hypersensitive.** After a
     disarm from rung 5 the ladder cascaded 4→3→2→1→0 on `s3_util` in
     50 s (dwells 27/32/11/6 s) with the bench's usual ~2 FEC repair
     episodes/s (`fec.log`: 44 in that window, the GS-uplink self-blanking
     class). At 60 fps one lost aggregate is ~1-2 % of a 500 ms window; at
     15 fps × 1 Mb/s the enh window holds ~15-30 symbols, so the same
     single loss reads `u3` 0.22-0.29 against `s3_down_util 0.15` and
     demotes after `confirm_ms`. Expect the low-power ladder to saw-tooth
     on a lossy bench rather than hold a rung; NOT fixed — it is the
     window/threshold design meeting a 4-8x thinner stream, and the
     right answer (a window in AUs, or a per-loss-event floor) is a
     separate spec.
  3. **A live fps drop booked phantom vanishes.** `FramePipeline`'s vanish
     period is an EMA over "normal" deltas only, so after the 60→15 fps
     rebind every 66.7 ms step read as a 4x hole: `vanished` ran 3/4 →
     5578/5582 in four minutes at a flat 15 reads/s (3 per frame), and
     the Telem counters saturate. Link-inert (the self-IDR latch has no
     consumer), telemetry-corrupting. **Fixed:** `set_fps` raises a
     flag the hot thread consumes to `note_rate_change()` before scoring
     the next pts (`frame_pipeline_rate_change_reanchors_the_period_
     instead_of_booking_holes`).

  Follow-up the same night: `low_power.fps` raised **15 → 30** in the
  bundle (and on the drone). At 30 fps the windows hold twice the symbols,
  the single-loss quantum halves, and the bench ladder climbed to mcs 5
  and held instead of saw-toothing — item 2 mitigated by config, the
  windowing question itself still open.

  What is still unmeasured is the arm step itself: at ARM,
  `run_bitrate_policy(force=true)` raises the encoder from 1 Mb/s to the
  current rung's full budget in one write. On the bench the ladder was at
  rung 0 at arm (item 1), so the step was small; with item 1 fixed the
  rung at arm can be anything the thin stream converged on, never loaded
  at full rate. Read post-flight: the rung at the `drone.low_power`
  false-edge (or `rc: low_power EXIT (armed)` in the drone log) and
  whether a demote follows within ~5 s. If real, the fix is a ramp, or
  holding the ladder down until the first full-rate windows have scored.
- **ROI interaction.** Entering low power trips `roi_low_` — 1000 kbps is
  under `encoder.roi_threshold_kbps` (3000) — so RcAgent issues
  `set_roi_qp(-24)` on the way in and `set_roi_qp(0)` on the way out.
  That is harmless *today* only because `[venc.roi] enabled = false`
  short-circuits in `apply_roi_qp`. Re-enable ROI and the low-power
  transition silently inherits the 2026-09-06 rung-0-demote-IDR hazard
  (an IDR encoded at `roi_qp_low`); note also that Telem/maburtop will
  read `roi -24` for the whole pre-arm period while ROI does nothing.
- **Observability.** Telem flags bit7 → sideport `drone.low_power`,
  maburtop `LP` (SYS row and the DRONE panel's SoC line), the compact
  OSD's fps cell in caution colour while the sideport is fresh; stderr
  `rc: low_power ENTER fps=15 cap=1000 kbps` / `EXIT (armed|stale)`; the
  `stats:` line carries `lp= armed=`. Every recording now opens with a
  low-power segment that `flightreport.py` cannot see — see
  `docs/data-provenance.md`, 2026-09-20.
