# Observability — which tool for what

The **stats sideport** is the primary debug surface. maburgs pushes a JSON
datagram (schema v1) to UDP `127.0.0.1:8300` every 500 ms: per-card and
per-RF-class signal stats, link op point, per-stream FEC health, video/AU-ring
health, TX/injection rates, airtime estimate, and drone telemetry (state,
applied op, encoder, queues, uplink RF, temps — via the 1 Hz T_TELEM
control frame); `link.ctl` carries the ladder controller's rung, util,
probation/counters, and last-transition reason, and `tools/flightreport.py`
is the post-flight analyzer over a recorded jsonl. ⚠ Superseded
2026-09-04: promotes used to probe the candidate MCS by moving the whole
ENH stream to it (`CAP_S3_PROBE`/`CAP_ENH_PROBE`, both deleted, RC_VERSION
5 → 6); the drone now always sends a dedicated probe-stream canary (SBI
sid 5) behind every ENH AU and the ladder's promote trigger consults the
continuous verdict instead of starting a discrete probe — see
`docs/link-adaptation.md` "Probe stream" and `link.probe` below. s3
residual/util loss demotes in steady state are unchanged (kill-switch
`link.s3_demote`); spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-probe-stream-design.md` (historical:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-s3-probe-promote-design.md`). Since
2026-08-31 (latency-accounting) `link.video.lat` carries the end-to-end
head-segment latency breakdown (`n`, and p50/p99 pairs for `enc`/`dq`/`air`/
`fec`) once the AU ring's SlotHdr v2 stamps are flowing — omitted, not
null, until then — and `maburplay`'s OSD grows a matching latency block
above the fps line, reading `--` while its own e2e-latency tracker is
cold or discontinuous.

**Per-card `crc_fail` is live since 2026-09-08.** The GS asks devourer to
keep FCS-failed frames (`rx.keep_corrupted`, RCR ACRC32|AICV on the 8822E,
set unconditionally in `gs/src/radio_frontend.cpp`), so a corrupt frame
reaches the aggregator, bumps that card's `crc_fail`, stays out of the seq
walk, and hands its body to the UEP decoder, which keeps the SBI
sub-blocks whose own CRC16 still passes. Per stream the sideport carries
`corrupt` (FCS-corrupt bodies delivered), `salvaged` (CRC16-clean
sub-blocks taken out of them) and `sub_fail` (sub-blocks that failed, from
any body), and since 2026-09-09 `salvage_only` — seqs whose ONLY arrival
inside the arrival guard was a salvaged sub-block (a second "heard clean"
bit in the ArrivalTracker, booked at settle time). `salvaged` is the
upper bound and `salvage_only` the value: the other card's clean copy of
the same body shadows most salvaged sub-blocks (flights 0043/0044,
`docs/sbi-salvage-flights-2026-09-09.md`), and a salvaged repair symbol
never counts here because it carries no seq of its own.
`flightreport.py` prints them as a SALVAGE section — totals per
card/stream and the deltas per rung next to that rung's abandoned
symbols, which is the post-flight answer to "what did salvage buy"
(`salvage_only` appears only on recordings that carry the key). Before
that date the WMAC dropped those frames on the
chip and `crc_fail` was structurally 0 — not "no damage", "damage never
seen". Foreign traffic that fails FCS is counted too (the SA filter cannot
trust a corrupt address), so a busy channel shows a slow `crc_fail` creep
with the drone off; `MABUR_GAPLOG=1` prints one `crcfail card=… sid=…`
line per event, `sid=-1` being the foreign ones.

Since 2026-09-01 that block is **two rows, `LAT P50 <n> ms` and
`LAT P99 <n> ms`**, right-flushed under the `RTT` row. Each is ONE REAL
FRAME from the last 1 s window, ranked by e2e. Read them together:
`P99` alone is a tail statistic sitting among averages (fps/jit/mbps)
and gets misread as typical — an operator reporting "fec is 10–30 ms"
while the median was ~10 ms is what prompted the second row
(`docs/dq-spike-findings-2026-08-31.md` §20).

**2026-09-06: the per-segment breakdown left the OSD.** Each row used to
render its frame's own seven segments (`enc dq air+ fec dec reg dsp`)
beside the headline — never independently-ranked percentiles, so a row's
segments summed to its own headline. That is now a post-flight question
only: the `lat:` jsonl line and `flightreport.py` carry the same
decomposition with more resolution, and on the glass it cost a
full-width column whose left edge reached into the centre-of-frame
keep-clear band. **The sideport `link.video.lat` block is unchanged** —
segment p50/p99 pairs still ship there, so maburtop and the recorders
lost nothing.

Since 2026-09-02 (link-rtt) `link.rtt` carries a clock-sync-free
**control-path RTT** and the pts-clock offset behind the absolute LAT
floor: the drone echoes which RCF `rcf_age_ms` ages against
(`Telem.rcf_seq_echo`, validity = flags bit3) plus its MI-domain clock at
telem build (`pts_at_build`), and maburgs matches the echo against its
recorded send times — `rtt = (telem_rx − rcf_send) − rcf_age`, every
1 Hz telem a sample. Keys: `ms` (EWMA), `min_ms` (session min — the
floor bound), `n`, `pts_off_us` (min-RTT-filtered `pts − GS-mono`; null
until the drone ships a usable pts clock), `floor_ms` (maburgs' anchor +
offset = absolute network floor). The whole block is null until the
first matched sample. Read it as CONTROL-path time: the telem reply
queues behind video on the drone's half-duplex TX, so `ms` inflates
under saturation (honest congestion signal, not PHY RTT), and the
offset's residual error is the up/down asymmetry of the best samples,
±1–2 ms class. On the player OSD the offset (combined with the player's
OWN anchor) folds the floor into the `LAT P50`/`LAT P99` headlines, and
each carries a `~` prefix while its e2e is still relative (estimator
cold, or sync lost at range: the floor freezes at last-good and drifts
~1 ms/min of outage). Before 2026-09-06 the floor was folded into the
`air+` segment too, so the on-screen breakdown still summed to the
headline; with the breakdown gone only the headline takes it. An
`RTT <n> ms` field sits one row above `LAT P50`, sharing its right edge;
it is adjacent for one-glance reading but is two-way control time and
never part of the e2e sum. What the absolute rows still exclude: sensor
exposure/readout before the pts stamp (~10–16 ms est.) and everything
past scanout start (HDMI + display processing) — LED/camera-lump
territory, see `docs/latency-budget-findings-2026-08-31.md`.

`link.rcf_slot` (2026-09-03) counts how the RCF slotter released each
control-frame send: `au` (at an AU completion with idle ahead, incl. the
in-grace immediate sends), `probe` (2026-09-05: at the probe body's
arrival — the release for every ENH burst while a probe is commanded),
`timeout` (hold reached `link.rcf_slot_hold_ms`), `passthru` (slotter
off, or no AU in the last 100 ms). Cumulative; diff across records.
`tail_ub_ms` is the slotter's learned completion→probe deadline (a lost
probe's fallback release; ceil(decaying max) + 1). Healthy video = almost
all `au`+`probe`, `timeout` well under 1 % — ⚠ at a high duty cycle
(bench pinned mcs4, ~4 ms idle per 16.7 ms) `timeout` runs ~43 %, and
with `feedback_ms` 50 = 3 AU periods those timeouts are phase-locked to
the burst, see `docs/probe-blanking-fix-findings-2026-09-05.md`. See
`docs/link-adaptation.md` "RCF slotting".

`link.streams[].arr_expected / arr_arrived / arr_expected_stale /
arr_arrived_stale / arr_late` (2026-09-05, arrival tracker): cumulative
arrival-time pre-FEC accounting, the ladder's util input since ctllog
11 — `expected` is seq advance past a 32-seq settle line, `arrived` what
was heard, `_stale` the pre-transition share the watermark attributes to
the old rung, `late` symbols heard after their seq was already booked
missing (healthy = 0; a rising `late` means reorder deeper than the
guard and the tracker is under-counting arrivals). Current-only loss =
`1 − Δ(arrived−arrived_stale)/Δ(expected−expected_stale)`.

Consume the same numbers programmatically with:

- `maburtop` on the GS (`tools/maburtop.py`) — full-screen console,
  grouped by link; color thresholds carry the judgment. Binds :8300
  directly — nothing else holds the port any more.
- Debug logs: maburgs writes a per-session directory when `debug_log.enable`
  is set — `<debug_log.dir>/NNNN/` holding `ctl.log`, `probe.log`, `au.log`,
  `scan.log`, `fec.log`, `arq.log`, `ta.log` (only while the turnaround bench
  runs) and `flight.jsonl`; maburplay writes `lat.log` into the same directory by
  following the `/tmp/mabur-session` marker and holds no logging config of
  its own. The loader default is **off**, but the shipped bundle
  (`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`) turns it **on** since the
  feedback-repair data-gathering build (`docs/feedback-repair-rollout.md`,
  which needs `arq.log` from every flight). A GS whose `/config/maburgs.toml`
  predates that keeps its own value: the image seeds `/config` only with
  files that are missing.
  The marker lives in tmpfs, so a reboot starts a new session while a 2 s
  wrapper respawn rejoins the current one and appends (which is why a format
  marker line can appear more than once in a file). **A drone restart is a
  new flight (2026-09-08):** when T_TELEM's `tlm_seq` steps backwards by
  more than 100 (maburd restarts it from 0; a fade or re-rendezvous keeps it
  climbing) maburgs rotates in place — next NNNN, marker rewritten, all five
  files (`flight.jsonl`, `ctl.log`, `probe.log`, `au.log`, `scan.log`)
  reopened under it with their format marker at the top — with no
  process restart and no video blink; maburplay's `lat.log` follows the
  marker within 5 s. Cumulative sideport counters do NOT reset at a
  rotation (same maburgs process), so the new `flight.jsonl` starts at
  nonzero values; `flightreport.py` differences within the file. A maburd
  crash-restart mid-flight therefore splits that flight in two, by design. Every file shares one
  CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock, so any two rows join directly — there is no `# sync`
  bridge any more. `ctl.log`, `probe.log` and `au.log` share one writer
  thread (`gs/src/log_writer.h`) whose per-stream ring can fill under load;
  when it does, the writer counts the dropped lines and, at its next 1 Hz
  flush, appends `# dropped N` into the affected file so the gap is always
  visible in the data itself — this is the v4 hole-signal, replacing the
  external reader's `# resync` marker (below). `flight.jsonl` opts out
  (`mark_drops=false`: NDJSON can't carry a comment line, and a gap is
  already visible there from the datagram's own `seq` field). Analysis:
  `flightreport.py <session-dir>` (also
  `flightjitter.py`, `airdrain.py`, `probesend.py`); with no argument they
  take the highest-numbered session. Replaces `flightrec.py`/`S95flightrec`,
  deleted 2026-09-06.

  `cal.log` (`gs/src/cal_log.h`, `callog 1` format marker) sits in the same
  session directory but does not follow the rule above: it writes
  regardless of `debug_log.enable` — that knob governs continuous
  per-second flight logging, and a calibration run is a bounded (~380-line)
  trace on a deliberate operator action, the sole record of what
  `maburcal start` measured. With logging off it falls back to
  `<debug_log.dir>/cal` instead of a numbered session, and either way
  `maburgs` prints the resolved path to stderr at the start of a run. Its
  shape is `callog 1` once, then one `R <nonce> <base_ref> <margin_db>` per
  calibration run (a retry — narrow flag, move the drone, run again — adds
  another `R` line to the same file rather than rotating it, so one
  `cal.log` can hold several runs; a reader keys `C`/`W`/`V` rows by the
  most recent `R`), `C` per measured cell, `W` per rate at each phase-end
  (coarse then fine — last-write-wins), and `V` per verify cell.
  `maburcal report <cal.log>` re-renders a saved run; see
  `docs/calibration.md`.

  `au.log` carries per-AU meta rows, SlotHdr v3 since 2026-09-06 (the
  air-clock 12th column, `air_ms`), behind a `# aulog 4` marker line —
  written at file open and re-written on every reopen, so a respawn
  within the session appends a second copy (`t_us pts sid fid len flags
  nal0 t_first t_complete enc dq air_ms`; a log without the marker is
  the pre-2026-08-31 7-column v1 format — `t_us pts sid fid len flags
  nal0` only — or, with a `# aulog 2` marker instead, the 2026-08-31
  SlotHdr v2 format, which adds `t_first t_complete enc dq` but not the
  trailing `air_ms` column). `aulog 4` is fed IN-PROCESS from
  `AuRingWriter::last_record()` (`gs/src/main.cpp`'s FrameStream finish
  callback; `gs/src/au_log.h`, `gs/src/au_ring.h`) — maburgs is the ring
  WRITER, so there is no mmap, no seqlock copy, and no epoch resync; unlike
  an outside reader, the writer cannot miss an AU to a ring overrun. Its
  hole-signal is the shared `# dropped N` marker described above — the v4
  equivalent of the `# resync` marker below. `t_us` in `aulog 4` is
  CLOCK_MONOTONIC µs, the same clock every other file in the session
  directory uses — in `aulog 1..3` (the last of those, `# aulog 3`, the
  SAME SlotHdr v3 columns as `aulog 4` but written only by the now-deleted
  `flightrec.py`, which read the rows from the `/dev/shm/mabur-au` ring
  from OUTSIDE maburgs exactly like `ausniff.py` — seqlock copy, epoch
  resync ⇒ `# resync` marker; attaches at the write head so pre-attach
  history can't be stamped with attach time) it was WALL-clock µs and the
  file carried `# sync <t_us> <t_ms>` anchors every 10 s to bridge to the
  jsonl's `t_ms`; a v4 log has neither the wall clock nor the anchors (see
  the scale-break note in `docs/data-provenance.md`).
  `t_first`/`t_complete` are the AU's SlotHdr v2 mono-µs latency stamps
  (first body / finish()); `enc`/`dq` are the drone's SBI-latched
  `enc_us`/`drone_q_ms` (venc encode time, TX queue wait) carried through
  on the AU's first fragment. Since 2026-08-31 (streaming push) `q_ms` is
  stamped at the body's actual TxQueue push and is the TRUE queue wait,
  ~0 when healthy — before that it also swallowed the venc-ring wait and
  the FEC/SBI CPU (~6 ms standing; see the scale-break note in
  `docs/data-provenance.md`).

  `tools/flightjitter.py` is the analyzer: reproduces the player's jitter
  EMA from the AU rows — using each row's `t_complete` as the arrival
  basis when present (the writer-stamped ring completion time, sharper
  than `t_us`'s reader-poll stamp), falling back to `t_us` for v1 rows —
  splits it into size-explained vs residual (airtime-model §4
  decomposition), and classifies each stutter event — `gap` /
  `rung-change` / `size` / `fec-wait` / `loss-recovery` / `transport` —
  using the jsonl for ladder and loss context (clock offset from the sync
  anchors on a pre-v4 au log; a v4 log needs no offset — same clock as the
  jsonl). `fec-wait` is direct per-frame evidence (the stutter AU's own
  `t_complete − t_first > 20 ms`), checked before the jsonl-inferred
  `loss-recovery` class so it wins when both apply. Tests: `ctest -R
  test_flightjitter`.

  Until 2026-09-06 the GS boot-started `/etc/init.d/S95flightrec` running
  `/root/flightrec.py`, an always-on Python daemon reading the sideport off
  UDP :8300 to write the jsonl and reading the AU ring from outside maburgs
  (seqlock copy, epoch resync) to write the au log — the only consumer of
  either, which meant `S95flightrec stop` before pointing maburtop or any
  ad-hoc UDP listener at :8300, and `start` after. The 2026-09-06
  consolidation deleted it: maburgs now writes `flight.jsonl` itself
  (straight from `StatsExporter`, no UDP round-trip, no second reader of
  the AU ring) and :8300 has exactly the one producer and no default
  consumer, so `maburtop` binds it directly. The adaptive-link record
  survives exactly as before, just relocated: maburgs writes its own
  compact `ctl.log` into the session directory whenever `debug_log.enable`
  is set in `/etc/maburgs.toml` (shipped default `false` — the bench GS
  turns it on), a `ctllog 11` header (v1 before 2026-08-14, v2/v3 that
  day's two waves, v4 since 2026-08-15 — pooled-RF note in
  `docs/link-adaptation.md` — … v10 since 2026-09-04, probe stream, v11
  since 2026-09-05, arrival-booked u/u3) followed by compact S/E/P/N/R
  lines (rung/state, ctl events, probe gate edges,
  penalties, per-rung EWMA store snapshots). Since ctllog 10 the `S` line
  carries three trailing probe columns (`probe_rung probe_u probe_n`, `-1
  nan 0` when nothing is commanded) and the `P` line is REPURPOSED: it used
  to be one row per discrete 2 s probe attempt (`pass|fail|abort`), and is
  now one row per PROBE GATE STATE EDGE (`clean|lossy|noinfo`) — a gate
  edge, not a probe outcome; do not pool v9-and-earlier P rows against v10
  ones. `flightreport.py` auto-detects this format alongside the jsonl
  format, so no separate invocation is needed. The controller-side tuning
  invariants that govern what those lines mean live in
  `docs/link-adaptation.md`. Its `PROBE GATE` report scores the edges as a
  demote predictor for the v2 threshold: per demote episode, `lead` is
  the time from the FIRST lossy edge since the held rung was entered (the
  last `E` line before the episode, either direction) — edges before that
  transition were measured under a different hold and never count (the
  2026-09-05 version searched unbounded and reported 5-19 s "leads" that
  simply predated the promote) — and a lossy edge is a false alarm unless
  the next `E` line is a demote within 10 s, so an edge the gate overrode
  with a promote stays a false alarm even if that next hold then fails.

  ⚠ Since 2026-09-04 the ctl log (and with it the probe log below) also
  opens in **static-pin mode** (`link.static_mcs >= 0`) — it used to be
  skipped there, since a pinned link never ticks the adaptive controller
  and so had no rung decisions to record, but the pinned bench runs are
  exactly the ones whose per-body probe log matters (spec §8.3 steps 1-2).
  A pinned `S` line's controller columns are frozen and uninformative
  (`u`/`util` read 0, `E`/`P`/`N`/`R` records never fire): only its probe
  columns move, `<probe_rung> nan <probe_n>` — `probe_rung` is
  `min(probe.rung_offset, top)` off a frozen `idx_ == 0`, `u` is `nan`
  because the gate never leaves `Off`, and `probe_n` is the real count of
  expected blocks (nonzero whenever `link.probe.pin_mcs >= 0`, 0
  otherwise) — so in pin mode only the probe rows, and the `probe.log`
  they summarize, carry information.

  Per-body raw probe log: with `debug_log.enable` on, maburgs also writes
  `probe.log` into the session directory (`gs/src/probe_log.h`) — one row
  per finalized received probe body, at roughly the enh AU rate (≈5 MB/h
  at 30/s), far denser than the ctl log's dwell-period `S` lines and so
  its own file. Since the 2026-09-06 consolidation `probe.log` and
  `ctl.log` from one boot are siblings in the same session directory, so
  they pair by directory rather than by a shared NNNN (before that, NNNN
  was taken from the paired `CtlLog::index()` so a `probe-NNNN`/`ctl-NNNN`
  pair from one boot lined up). Header `probelog 3 bpb=<bpb>`, then `<t_ms>
  <seq> <mcs> <bw> <enh_fid> <blocks_ok> <card_mask> <snr_c0> <snr_c1>
  <evm_c0> <evm_c1> <first_ms>` per row (`probelog 2`, to 2026-09-24,
  lacked `bw` and is all 20 MHz; `probelog 1`, 2026-09-04 only, also lacked
  `first_ms`) — `t_ms` is the finalize tick (~10 ms coarse), `first_ms`
  the radio's arrival stamp of the body's first sight on any card (mono ms
  to 3 decimals, same CLOCK_MONOTONIC as `au.log`'s `t_complete`),
  `blocks_ok` is the union of surviving blocks, `card_mask` the bitmask of
  cards that delivered any block, snr/evm per-card in dB (`nan` when that
  card heard nothing this row). A row is written for EVERY finalized body,
  on- or off-profile: `mcs`/`bw` are that body's OWN profile, not the commanded
  one, so an RCF-lag body (arrives just after a profile switch, before the
  drone has caught up) still logs a row at its stale mcs instead of
  vanishing. A wholly-lost probe body is the only case with no row;
  `flightreport.py` derives it from `seq` gaps and the enh AU count and
  joins rows to `au.log` on `enh_fid` (nearest completion in time — the id
  wraps every ~36 min) to print the completion→probe offset percentiles
  (the episode report also prints an "s3-settle-refire canary" since
  2026-09-05 — demotes landing 300–360 ms after an `s3_residual` demote,
  the debris double-step `transition_edge.h` removed; ~0 expected)
  (`flightreport.py <session-dir>`, or the legacy explicit `probe-NNNN_
  <date>.log [au-NNNN.log]`; without the second argument the legacy form
  picks the au log in the same directory or `./log` whose mono range
  overlaps). `tools/bench/probesend.py` adds the GS send stamps from a
  `MABUR_GAPLOG=1` run to place every send against the probe
  (`docs/probe-blanking-fix-findings-2026-09-05.md`). Never fatal, like
  the ctl log.

  **fec.log (feclog 2; feclog 1 from 2026-09-15 had no `bw`).** Per-episode FEC loss record, the
  measurement behind "is the rung table's overhead pair oversized" —
  written by maburgs into the session directory (`gs/src/fec_log.h`),
  rotating with it, never fatal. A *loss episode* is a run of source
  symbols on one video layer that the channel never delivered directly
  (repair-recovered-then-heard symbols do NOT count: the repair merely won
  an arrival race), merged with any other such run within one repair
  window of it, since those compete for the same repairs. `SwDecoder`
  books it at horizon eviction — the only point where "never delivered" is
  final — so a row lands roughly a horizon after the loss. Header
  `feclog 2`, then `<t_ms> <sid> <mcs> <bw> <ov> <first_seq> <span> <m>
  <rec> <aband> <stale> <r> <w>` per row: drain tick (mono ms, ~10 ms coarse),
  video layer (0 base / 1 enh), the op MCS and width (`feclog 1` rows are
  20 MHz) and that sid's commanded
  overhead at drain time (so a row scores against its own rung with no
  ctl.log join), wire seq of the first missing source, seqs spanned,
  missing = recovered + abandoned, of those how many fell below the
  transition watermark (`stale`, the same debris class the ladder
  excludes), distinct covering repairs received (`r`, a two-card copy
  counts once) and the repair window as flown (`w`). `flightreport.py`'s
  FEC EPISODES section groups rows per (sid, mcs, bw, ov) and prints, for the
  non-stale ones, the overhead each episode would have needed,
  `ov_req = (sqrt(1+4c)−1)/2` with `c = m·ov·(1+ov)/r` — at overhead x the
  same lost air carries `m(1+ov)/(1+x)` sources against `r·x/ov` covering
  repairs — plus how many episodes would have failed at 0.25/0.35/0.50/
  0.75/1.00. Read it as the input to a *static* retune of
  `[[link.ladder]]`'s `overhead_base`/`overhead_enh`: a single lost agg-6
  aggregate at ov 1.0 / w 32 models to ~0.5, so the shipped 1.0/0.5 pair
  is the first thing a flight's max/p99 will judge. Nothing consumes the
  file live; `fec.log` alone is also a valid `flightreport.py` argument.
  Bench 2026-09-16 (session 0088, 80 s at rung 5, ausniff clean): base
  episodes are one lost aggregate each — `m` p50/max 11/16 against `r`
  ≈ 41, `ov_req` p50/max 0.40/0.46, zero would-fail at 0.50; enh (ov 0.5)
  `m` 12–16 against `r` ≈ 21, `ov_req` 0.38; ~0.75 episodes/s, the known
  ~1 lost agg-6/s. ⚠ The first ~18 s after a maburgs restart log a block
  of rung-0 episodes with `m` ≈ 200 and ~170 abandoned, `stale` 0 — the
  same boot warm-up loss that pollutes the rung-0 residual EWMA
  (`link.rungs[0]`), not a rung-0 verdict; drop them by time, or read
  only rungs the ladder actually held.

**arq.log (arqlog 1, 2026-09-28).** Feedback-repair shadow mode, phase 1
of `docs/feedback-repair-rollout.md`: at every burst end, how many repair
symbols each video layer is short -- exactly what a live "send me k more"
request would ask for -- written by maburgs (`gs/src/arq_shadow.h`,
`gs/src/arq_log.h`) into the session directory, rotating with it, never
fatal. Observes only: nothing extra is transmitted. The shortfall is
`SwDecoder::deficit()` (unknown live seqs minus pending independent rows,
0 exactly when nothing is missing), sampled `settle_ms` (4) after the burst
ends so the other card's tail copy lands first. A burst ends at the other
layer's first body (base and enh AUs alternate), at the trailing probe, at
a same-layer body after an 8 ms RX-stamp gap, or after 15 ms of silence.
Header `arqlog 1`, then two record types:
`E <t_open_ms> <sid> <mcs> <bw> <ov> <bpb> <dur_ms> <grow_ms> <nack> <d0> <dpk> <aband> <stale>`
is one shortfall episode -- consecutive short burst ends of one layer,
closed by the first one back at 0: when it opened (burst-end mono ms), the
op and overhead at open, FEC blocks per body (symbols -> bodies), how long
until the layer was whole again (`dur_ms` -- an in-band fix if `aband` is 0,
else the eviction of what was lost), how long the shortfall kept growing
(`grow_ms`: 0 = one burst, large = an outage), how many burst ends were
short (`nack`: the requests a live loop would have sent), the first and
peak shortfall in symbols, and the symbols abandoned inside the episode
(`stale` of them transition debris, excluded like fec.log's).
`S <t_ms> <sid> <bursts> <short>` every ~10 s per layer that had bursts:
the denominators. `flightreport.py`'s ARQ SHADOW section turns it into the
go/no-go: short-burst share and request rate per layer, peak shortfall in
aggregates (assumes `ampdu.max_num` 6 bodies), in-band fix delay and what a
repair at an 8 ms round trip would save, and lost episodes split into
burst-shaped (<= 2 aggregates, grew <= 50 ms: one repair round could have
saved them) vs outage-shaped. `maburgs --dry-run` runs the same tracker
over a replay and prints `arq_shadow <sid>:` totals on stderr (order-only:
the replay clock is synthetic). First flight data: two indoor flights,
2026-10-03 (`docs/feedback-repair-rollout.md` "Phase 1 results").

**link.listen (2026-10-07).** The listen window, phase 3 of
`docs/feedback-repair-rollout.md`. GS side, cumulative: `on` (statuses going
out now: `[listen] ms` > 0, the A/B phase, in session, the drone advertises
`CAP_LISTEN`, no calibration sweep), `ms`, `ab_s`, `sent` and its split by
what marked the burst end (`probe`, `deadline`, `completion`), `late_max_ms`
(worst core-loop delay from that mark to the send). `drone` is the latest
`T_LWSTAT`, per drone period — sum it once per `seq` (both cards hear it):
`ms` (the gap the drone kept), `status_rx`, `hist` (8 bins of RX time minus
the AU's modelled burst end: <0, 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-7, ≥7 ms),
`nofid` (no gap on record for that AU), `gate_holds` / `gate_hold_sum_ms` /
`gate_hold_max_ms` (AU first bodies and late repairs the gap held), and
`direct_holds` (control/MSP/pong sends it held); `rx_ms` is the GS arrival.
null until the first report. **Phase 3b (2026-10-09)** drones send
`T_LWSTAT` v2 (`rc_proto.h`): `hist` bins become <0, 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8,
8-10, 10-15, ≥15 ms after the burst's modelled end, and the report carries
`inside` (statuses that landed inside their window), the learned window
`delay`, and `fit_skips` (windows cut to nothing before the next AU) in
place of `nofid` and `direct_holds`. A GS built since exports `v` (1 or 2)
and, for v2, `inside`, `delay_ms`, `fit_skips`; an older GS exports the v2
body raw — `ms` with bit 7 set (132 = v2, 4 ms), `nofid` = inside,
`direct_holds` = delay_100us << 8 | fit_skips. `flightreport.py` decodes
both.

**ta.log (talog 1, 2026-10-04).** The turnaround bench, phase 2 of
`docs/feedback-repair-rollout.md`: how long a status frame takes to turn into
a reply on air while the drone's video queue is loaded, per drone hardware TX
queue. Written by maburgs (`gs/src/ta_log.h`) into the session directory,
rotating with it, never fatal, and only when `[turnaround] rate_hz` is set
(it is 0, off, in the bundle). The GS sends `T_TA_PING` at jittered random
times (not in the RCF slot, so every queue state gets sampled), lanes round
robin; maburd answers each with `T_TA_PONG` on the hardware queue the ping
names (`drone/src/ta_responder.h`, devourer `TxMode::hw_queue`). Raw
sightings, paired offline:
`talog 1 rate_hz=<r> lanes=<a,b,..> frames=<n> bytes=<b>` header (re-written
on a respawn, which also restarts ping seqs at 0 -- never pair across one);
`S <seq> <lane> <card> <t_call_us> <t_done_us>` a ping handed to TX card
`card` (the two stamps bracket the synchronous send);
`H <card> <seq> <tsfl> <t_us>` card `card` heard the GS's own ping -- the
witness, which can only be a card that did not send it;
`O <card> <seq> <lane> <idx> <n> <tsfl> <t_us> <hold_us> <txq> <pool> <backlog_100us> <rssi>`
card `card` heard reply frame `idx` of `n`, with what the drone stamped: its
hold from RX callback to that frame's send call, its TxQueue and USB-pool
depths and its air-clock backlog (0.1 ms units) at that call, plus the
frame's RSSI (dBm, better chain; 0 without PHY status);
`X <card> <type> <len>` card `card` heard an FCS-clean `T_TA_PING`/`T_TA_PONG`
(`type` 7/8) of `len` body bytes that did not parse -- a wire/parser mismatch,
counted so it cannot pass for replies that never came (the first phase-2
flight lost every pong this way: the GS RX body keeps the 4-byte FCS and the
pong parser read its CRC from the very end). `tsfl` is the
receiving card's hardware RX TSF (us, low 32 bits, wraps every ~71.6 min),
so `O.tsfl - H.tsfl` for one seq on one card is the on-air turnaround on a
single clock; `t_us` is GS host mono time (the host round trip, which adds
both USB paths). `flightreport.py`'s TURNAROUND section pairs them: per
lane, replies received, on-air turnaround p50/p90/p99 (first reply frame,
and the whole burst when `n` > 1), host round trip, drone hold, loaded vs
idle queue, per rung when `ctl.log` is beside it, and the phase-2 gate on the
on-air p99. tsfl's latch point (frame start or end) is undocumented; either
way it moves the turnaround by one short control frame's airtime.

**scan.log (scanlog 2).** New per-session file (spec
2026-09-13-auto-channel-select, extended by
2026-09-14-inflight-channel-hop), opened alongside `ctl.log` whenever
`debug_log.enable` is set. Six record letters, one line each — `A` (the
1 Hz in-flight energy poll) is **gone**, along with
`radio.scan.energy_period_ms`: the in-flight hop's verdict-window reads
(§below) replaced it as the in-session energy source, at ~150 ms cadence
instead of 1 Hz:

- `C` — a card's adapter-caps identity plus sensor validity flags, once at
  bring-up.
- `D` — one scout dwell (the channel-ranker's raw input) — boot-time or
  in-session, distinguished by a trailing `sess` flag and three step-timing
  columns the in-flight scout added.
- `K` — the pick at freeze, with the full ranking.
- `M` — a GS retune that changes where the link lives (`commit`,
  `ack_override`, `split_home`, `reunite`, plus the hop reasons
  `hop_lead`/`hop_follow`/`hop_withdraw`/`hop_one_card`).
- `V` — one verdict-engine window, on every verdict change and every
  non-healthy window.
- `H` — one hop-controller event (`order`, `lead_confirm`,
  `one_card_retune`, `verify_pass`, `verify_fail`, `withdraw`, `hold_cap`,
  `hold_exhausted`, each `would_`-prefixed while `hop.enable = false`).

Full formats, the config, the sideport keys it feeds, and the
`cca − own` ranking assumption for the boot-time (`C`/`D`/`K`/`M`) records
are in `docs/channel-select.md`; the in-flight hop's rule table, evidence
bits, hop sequence, and Known limitations are in
`docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`.

**Sideport: `hop` and `cards[i].dwell`.** Since 2026-09-14
(in-flight-channel-hop) a new top-level `hop` object is unconditional
(idle defaults while `hop.enable = false`, matching `link.probe`'s
pattern): `hop = {enable, verdict, evidence, ref_rung, epoch, state
(idle|ordered|verifying|hold), target, hops, holds, last_ms}` — `ref_rung`
and `target` are `null` while unfrozen / before the first-ever order,
`last_ms` is `null` until any hop event has fired this session. Per card,
`cards[i].dwell` (`null` until that card's first completed dwell) carries
`{visits, score, cost_us}` — `visits` is cumulative over every dwell,
success or failure; `score`/`cost_us` are the last **successful** dwell's,
since a failed retune produces no visit to score. `cards[i].energy` keeps
its pre-existing shape but is now refilled from the verdict engine's
~150 ms window reads instead of the deleted 1 Hz `A`-record poll. Since
2026-09-25 (NHM airtime evidence, `docs/nhm-airtime-spike-findings-2026-09-25.md`)
it also carries `busy_pct` (NHM busy %, `null` when that window's reading
was invalid or none has landed) and `own_air_pct` (the GS's own
reconstructed airtime on that card, `null` only before the first window).
`tools/maburtop.py`'s header gains `hop <state>/<verdict>` and its
per-card `busy` column tracks `cards[i].energy` at the new cadence, plus a
further `fbusy` column (`max(0, busy_pct − own_air_pct)`, clamped so a
stale `own_air_pct` past a fresher `busy_pct` can't read negative) — the
same foreign-busy-airtime figure the verdict's `blocked` bit and both
rankers use (renamed from `air%` in the final-review fix wave: the column
was always foreign busy, never own airtime). Full key semantics, the OSD
`(h)` mark, and the
`flightreport.py` HOP section are in `docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`.

**Sideport: `link.probe` and `classes.probe`.** Since 2026-09-04 the probe
stream's live gate state is exported unconditionally (even in static-pin
mode, where there is no controller) as `link.probe = {on, rung, mcs,
state, u, loss, streak_bodies, n, exp, rx, off_profile, cards:[{loss, rx}]}`
(`streak_bodies` replaced `streak_ms` on 2026-09-16 with the body-count
clean streak, `link.probe.clean_bodies`; recordings before that date carry
`streak_ms`)
— `u`/`loss` are `null` when the gate has no usable sample yet. `classes`
gains a `probe` entry alongside `s0`/`s1`/`msp`/`ctrl` (`RfClass::Probe`,
`kNumRfClasses` 5) with the probe stream's own per-card RSSI/SNR/EVM —
`classes.s2`/`classes.s3` are gone (they were always empty since the
2026-08-29 UEP flatten). `link.rungs[].probe_u`/`probe_n` MEAN something
different from before this date too — see `docs/data-provenance.md`.
`maburtop`'s LADDER panel replaces its old "last probe" line with a live
gate line: `probe: r3 mcs5 clean 54b u0.12 n48 | c0 0.00 c1 0.05` (`54b` =
the clean streak in bodies), and its
signal panel gains the `probe` class in `CLASS_ORDER`.

**Loss-sim rig covers the probe stream too.** `LossSim::kStreams` (bench
rig, `MABUR_LOSS_SIM` builds only, see `docs/airtime-model.md` §4) is
`s0..s5`, `5` = probe — `tools/bench/losssim.py s5 eff=<pct>` injects
loss on the probe stream for the gate's refusal test (design spec §8.3
step 3: parked clean, inject, expect `Lossy`/`probe_holds`, no promote).
Host build for that rig: `cmake -S . -B build-losssim
-DDEVOURER_DIR=$PWD/../devourer -DMABUR_LOSS_SIM=ON` (gitignored dir,
separate from the normal `build/`).

**Rule of thumb: if you want to KNOW something about the running link,
read the sideport. Reach for other tools only in these cases:**

- **Verifying maburgs itself → `tools/bench/ausniff.py`** (on the GS:
  `python3 ausniff.py --ring /dev/shm/mabur-au --seconds 30 --json`). It
  attaches to the AU ring read-only from OUTSIDE the daemon. This is the
  standing regression gate for any change that touches maburgs: the
  sideport is maburgs self-reporting, so gating a maburgs change on the
  sideport is circular — a bug that mangles frames or lies in its own
  counters sails through. Never replace the ausniff gate with sideport
  numbers. (Oneshot/post-hoc reads of a quiescent ring are exact; live
  mode is best-effort — Python cannot fence.) Host-side, the same
  invariant is `ctest -R 'gs_e2e|gs_au_e2e|player_e2e'` (byte-exact
  fixture-to-ring/AU comparisons via `verify_aus.py`/`--out-aus`).
- **Per-frame `air` excess around rung transitions → `tools/bench/airdrain.py`**
  (`python3 tools/bench/airdrain.py ctl-NNNN_<date>.log log/au-NNNN.log
  [--profiles]`, host-side, no lat log needed). Replays the player's
  `air` arithmetic over the AU log — `t_first − enc − q − pts` minus a
  `PtsAnchor`-style leaky min floor with the 2 s pts-discontinuity reset
  — and joins the ctl log's E lines: per cascade the 250 ms-binned excess
  around the first demote with IDRs marked, peak / time-to-peak / settle,
  the 1 s pre-demote excess, and the first-500 ms on-air bytes against
  the new rung's nominal PHY rate; single-demote and promote peaks;
  steady-state excess per rung; standalone spike seconds; and, since
  2026-09-06, a **transition IDRs** table — every non-starved `E` line
  with the first base IDR completing within 600 ms of it, kB p50/max
  by target rung split demotes | promotes and the ratio to the
  post-transition base P (`--profiles` lists every row). That table is
  the `venc.min_iqp` tuning readout (`docs/airtime-model.md`): read the
  rung-0 demote column after a flight, then move the floor. This is the
  §9 measurement of `docs/probe-stream-flight-findings-2026-09-05.md`
  and the A/B instrument for its drain-shed follow-up
  (`tests/test_airdrain.py` pins it on a synthetic cascade). The ctl and
  au indices are separate counters: pair them by mono span. The default
  window runs from the first E line to the last S line; a starve opens
  no episode (until 2026-09-06 it ended the window at the first
  `starved` E line, which read flight 0031 as 72 s of 566). `--model` on
  the three 2026-09-06 flights:
  `docs/air-clock-flight-findings-2026-09-06.md`, which also gives the
  per-AU reconstruction of the drone clock from `air_ms` (a candidate
  `--fit` mode).
- **Verifying AU-completion cadence → `tools/bench/aucadence.py`** (on the
  GS: `python3 aucadence.py --ring /dev/shm/mabur-au --seconds 25 --json`).
  Same outside-the-daemon ring posture as ausniff; reports the base−enh
  completion offset (p50 of `arrival_mono − pts` per class, IDR-excluded —
  metric provenance in `docs/airtime-balance-spike-findings-2026-08-29.md`).
  This is the **standing acceptance number for any change touching the
  AirBalancer, the venc pipeline, UEP overhead, or the bitrate policy** —
  the sideport `jitter_ms` EMA is the symptom of this offset and is noisier
  (±1.4 ms vs ±0.5 ms), so judge on the offset. Baselines recorded at the
  2026-08-30 v4 flag-day acceptance, mcs5 park: **−1.1 to −3.0 ms
  enh-late depending on scene/frame size** (21–33 KB frames, ~9.5 Mbps;
  balancer verified at its equal-air optimum 0.71/1.29 throughout, so the
  residual is encoder-side per-class completion latency — SVC-T
  alternation, scene-dependent) and **+1.1 ms at a pinned-mcs2** run
  (partly the 0.5×cmd rail). Regression criterion at the mcs5 park:
  **`--gate-ms 4.0`** — inside the known encoder envelope anything passes;
  a transport regression (lost balance, one-sided overhead, rate misroute)
  shows as the offset leaving that envelope. The design target ≤0.5 ms
  becomes the gate once the open venc-class-latency work lands. A capture whose
  per-class count is under `--min-samples` (default 100) is refused, not
  scored — enh silence (shed, loss-sim kill) is not a cadence sample.
- **Packet-level forensics → capture tools** (`tools/bench/seqdump.py`,
  `decode_bodies.py`, `live_decode.py`/`live_play.py`). The sideport is
  aggregates; when a summary number looks wrong, these record raw bodies
  for offline dissection. (The RTP-era FU tools — `fu_probe.py`,
  `fu_chain_analyze.py` — survive for reading OLD recordings only.)
- **Player tail-latency persistence → `lat.log`** (since 2026-08-31,
  vsync-locked-regulator; relocated by the 2026-09-06 consolidation). The
  player's 1 Hz `lat:` stderr line used to die in tmpfs with the power-off
  (`/tmp/maburplay.log`, gone on reboot — this is how the flight-0035 tail
  segments were lost, see `docs/latency-budget-findings-2026-08-31.md`). It
  is now additionally appended to `lat.log` inside maburgs' current session
  directory — maburplay holds no logging config of its own, it just follows
  the `/tmp/mabur-session` marker maburgs writes and stops if the marker
  disappears. Format: `# latlog 2` then one `<mono_us> <lat-payload>` line
  per second, line-buffered; there is no `# sync` bridge — maburgs and
  maburplay both stamp CLOCK_MONOTONIC on the same box, so `lat.log`'s rows
  join the session's other files directly. (`# latlog 1`, before this
  change, needed the bridge to line up against the flight jsonl's `t_ms`,
  and lived at `<display.lat_log_dir>/lat-NNNN.log` under its own next-free
  index, unrelated to the flightrec-written `au`/`flight` index or maburgs'
  `ctl` index — pairing an old recording still needs the mono-span/`#
  sync` matching described in `docs/data-provenance.md`; a session
  directory needs none of it, since `lat.log` is simply the file next to
  `ctl.log`.) A failed open (DVR not mounted yet, or no session yet) is
  retried every 30 s and never blocks or spams; it never blocks the stderr
  line either, which keeps going regardless. Since 2026-10-09 the same file
  also carries a 1 Hz `genlock:` line whenever `display.vsync_lock` is on
  (`gs/player/src/genlock.h`, `docs/efficient-link-plan.md` step 2):
  `on=` 1 while steering the camera, `cam=` the camera rate from the last
  ~4 s of pts (drone clock), `panel=` the screen rate, `phase=` the median
  time from a frame's capture to its next release deadline, `target=` where
  the loop holds it, `err=` the wrapped difference, `cmd=` the milli-fps
  setpoint sent (0 when observing), `n=` frames that second, `fps=` frames
  per real second (the 1:1 check: low power reads ~30), and two diagnostics
  of the raw pts the player sees, `pstep=` (median forward step, µs) and
  `pback=` (steps that went backwards or repeated). `cam=` is the phase
  slope against capture time (`f_screen × (1 + slope)`), not a pts step —
  the 2026-10-10 bench read `cam=0` at 60 fps from pts steps while the phase
  slope showed the beat exactly. The 1 Hz
  `regulator:` line (format below) is written there too since the same
  day — its counters are cumulative per player process, and flightreport's
  DISPLAY SMOOTHNESS section differences them (a drop = a player restart).
  Parsers that match `lat:` skip both. `tools/bench/latab.py
  latA.log latB.log` reads a pair of these logs and prints the vsync
  A/B verdict (four log-derived gates:
  `e2e` p50 B≤A−8, `dsp` p50 B≤6 (level), `dsp` p99 B≤A−8, `dsp` p50
  4 s-bucket sweep ≤3 (flatness, separate from the p50 level gate) —
  `anchor=warm` windows are excluded from all four,
  with a printed count); see `docs/bench-protocols-latency-2026-08-31.md`
  protocol 1 for the full arm procedure and the manual gates it doesn't
  cover.
- **Regulator line → vsync servo state** (since 2026-08-31). The 1 Hz
  `regulator:` stderr line in `/tmp/maburplay.log` gained
  `vsync=locked|fallback skips=<n> fallback=<n> pend=<n>`: `vsync=` is
  whether the vblank estimator is currently locked (servo release) or
  has fallen back to the old `anchor_floor(pts) + regulate_ms` rule;
  `skips=` counts deep-burst slot claims in servo mode — a frame whose
  natural vblank slot AND the next slot are both occupied claims the
  later one and the older occupant is dropped (bench steady state
  ~1–1.4/s at the mcs5 park, from fec-batch 4-frame bursts; ordinary
  servo drops surface as `replaced=` evictions instead). The beat wrap
  depends on which clock is faster. The 2026-08-31 bench measured a
  59.939 Hz sensor, slower than the 60.000 Hz panel: a ~16.4 s wrap with one
  panel repeat, visible in `--fps-log`, not here. The 2026-10-09 flights
  measured the camera at 60.078 fps — faster — so each ~12.8 s wrap throws
  one frame away instead (the CAMERA vs SCREEN report section reads the
  camera's rate from `au.log` on every flight;
  `docs/efficient-link-plan.md` step 2); `fallback=` counts frames
  released via the fallback rule while `display.vsync_lock` is on (climbs
  during a cold start or a stale estimator; cold start needs 8 exact flips
  to first warm, but validity is recency-based, so after a stall the
  counter stops within one fresh exact flip of flips resuming — the warm
  count saturates at 8 and never resets, it's only `last_exact_us_` that
  goes stale); `pend=` is the presenter's present()-while-flip-in-flight
  mailbox engagement count — a superset of the displaced-frame subset,
  0 with no presenter (decode-only or init failed). Since the bench
  session later the same day the line also carries `heals=` (chain-break
  slips: pending releases pushed one slot after two mailbox engagements
  within 100 ms — a backstop that fires ~only at startup now) and
  `pdrop=` (paced-mode mailbox drops: with the servo locked, a parked
  frame is a missed latch and is dropped at flip completion instead of
  resubmitted a period late — the mechanism that keeps a single miss
  from becoming a one-vsync-late chain; steady state ~0.2/s at
  `vsync_lead_ms` 6). A `pend` increment in servo mode therefore costs
  one dropped frame in the common case (two when the mailbox was already
  occupied — the replaced parked frame counts in `--fps-log`'s `repl=`,
  not on this line), never a chain. `pend`, `pdrop`, the regulator
  line's `replaced=`, and `--fps-log`'s `repl=` together are the full
  drop accounting. Since 2026-09-02 the line also carries the
  sequential-slot chain accounting — `chained=` (cumulative frames that
  took natural+1 vblank because a predecessor held their natural slot),
  `chain=` (current consecutive run), `chain_max=` (longest run),
  `chains=` (runs started — chains/s × mean length = chained/s) and
  `cuts=` (runs cut by `display.chain_budget`: the frame that would extend
  a run past the budget takes its natural slot and the held occupant is
  displaced — one dropped frame, counted in `replaced=` too).
  These are the OTHER kind of one-vsync-late chain, the one the servo
  itself creates: one collision (two decodes inside one vblank window)
  shifts every following frame a period late until an arrival gap wider
  than a period frees a slot. The extra period lands in the `lat:` line's
  `reg` segment, so read `chained/held` per second next to `reg` p50.
  Bench 2026-09-02 (mcs5 park, agg6+fb6, lead 6, 196 s): 38.9 % of held
  frames chained, per-second fraction 7–71 %, longest run 52 frames,
  `hold_ema` 13.1 ms with no chain running vs 18.1 ms with one — about
  6.5 ms of mean regulator hold (0.39 × 16.7) that the vblank lock does
  not need. Collisions come from arrival jitter (AU completion gaps 8–27
  ms, ~10 % under 10 ms), not from pair bunching — the AU ring shows
  frames completing one per period, not in pairs.
  **`display.chain_budget` A/B, same session, 150 s arms, budget 0 →
  6 → 0 → 3, config-only restarts** (`lat:` p50 means over 1 Hz windows,
  bootstrap 95 % CI vs arm A; A′ reproduced A within noise, e2e −0.2
  [−1.2, +0.8]):

  | budget | chained | chains/s | cuts/s | hold_ema | reg p50 mean | e2e p50 mean | reg p99 | lat n |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0 (A) | 39.7 % | 6.9 | 0 | 15.1 | 15.0 | 45.5 | 25.1 | 59.4 |
  | 6 (B) | 27.1 % | 6.4 | 0.56 | 13.1 | 12.3 (−2.7 [−3.5, −1.8]) | 43.0 (−2.4 [−3.3, −1.6]) | 24.1 | 58.8 |
  | 0 (A′) | 40.6 % | 6.9 | 0 | 15.4 | 15.1 | 45.3 | 25.0 | 59.4 |
  | 3 (C) | 19.6 % | 6.1 | 1.44 | 11.9 | 10.7 (−4.3 [−5.1, −3.5]) | 41.6 (−3.9 [−4.8, −3.0]) | 24.3 | 57.9 |

  Chains start ~7×/s with a mean length of 3.4 frames, so a budget
  only trims the long tail of runs: 6 buys 2.4 ms of median e2e for
  0.56 drops/s, 3 buys 3.9 ms for 1.44 drops/s, and budget 1 would be
  freshest-wins at ~7 drops/s. reg p99 is untouched by any budget (a
  chained frame plus a full phase margin is the p99 whatever the run
  length). present_jitter EMA rose 0.56 → 0.90 → 1.37 ms with the
  drops. Operator picked **3 as the shipped default** (2026-09-02); 0
  restores the unbounded behavior. The counters make either auditable.
- **Post-mortem when no consumer was listening → the 1 Hz stderr stats

  fps-log + respawn history in `/tmp/maburplay.log`; the burned-DVR stage
  times ride the fps-log as `burn_ct_ms=`/`burn_enc_ms=`, see
  `docs/colortrans.md`). It is
  numerically redundant with the sideport but persists on disk; the UDP
  feed is ephemeral. The MSP OSD is now rendered by maburplay itself, from
  the UDP snapshot feed maburgs emits (maburgs no longer draws pixels); the
  OSD startup line and blanking notices land in `/tmp/maburplay.log`
  alongside the fps-log. Since 2026-08-11 maburplay also drives the display
  at startup rather than at the first decoded frame: it modesets immediately
  with a splash image (`/usr/local/share/mabur/splash.bin`, raw XRGB8888,
  regenerate with `tools/gen_splash.py`) so the sink locks a mode before video
  exists, and it retries display acquisition once a second while none is
  connected — a display plugged in or powered on after the player started is
  picked up without a restart, which it never was before. That only holds if
  a display was NEVER acquired: one that disconnects after a successful
  acquire is still unrecoverable, deliberately (a stated non-goal — KMS
  retains CRTC state and a replug normally re-lights it on its own). Neither
  has a config key. The splash shows from process start, or from a late
  display acquire only when no frame has been decoded yet, until the first
  decoded frame — deliberately, because the image is an aerial photo that
  would read as a live feed if it ever appeared mid-flight, so a mid-flight
  replug comes up on video rather than on the photo. Two log lines cover a
  no-display episode (`no display at startup -- retrying`, `display acquired
  after N.N s`); the per-attempt DRM failures are silenced on purpose, since
  /tmp is tmpfs.
- **The GS link-status OSD on the screen is a sideport consumer, not a
  separate instrument.** maburplay draws it from the SAME datagram
  `maburtop` reads: `stats.out` in `/etc/maburgs.toml` is a list, and the
  bench GS fans out to `:8300` (maburtop / ad-hoc capture) and `:8302`
  (maburplay's `osd.gs.port`). So the screen and the recorder cannot
  disagree — if the OSD shows something surprising, the answer is in that
  jsonl, and `flightreport.py` will say the same thing with more
  precision. Config is
  `osd.gs` in `/etc/maburplay.toml` (`enable` default false, `stale_ms`
  dims every link-derived field after silence; fps/jitter/bitrate/REC are
  player-measured and never dim). `osd.gs.style` picks the layout, and
  **the shipped default is `"compact"`**: two plain-text rows along the
  bottom edge, radio above and picture below,

  ```
                                              ● REC 12:47   <- top right
  ...
  ch:149 mcs:5 air:62% rssi:-70/-72 snr:22/20 temp:41
  bitrate:8.1 res:1280x720 fps:60 jit:5.2 lat:45/78 loss:0.3/0.0
  ```

  — no meters, no bars, one type size for both rows: everything the
  four corner blocks show minus FEC, plus the channel, the decoded
  resolution, both latency percentiles and (since 2026-09-21) the drone
  SoC temperature from `drone.sys.soc_temp_c` (`temp:--` while
  unavailable). Two colour exceptions, both single-threshold because the
  palette has no third status colour: the `fps` cell turns caution while
  `drone.low_power` is set (`docs/link-adaptation.md`, "Low-power
  (disarmed) mode"), and `temp` turns caution from 70 °C. Text and layout
  are otherwise unchanged, and both tints drop while the sideport is
  stale. `"essential"` selects the older
  four-corner layout with the signal bars, the airtime meter and the status
  hues. Exactly one renders; there is no both, and an unrecognised value
  fails the config load rather than picking one. Three things about the bar
  are worth knowing before reading one on the bench: `ch` comes from the
  sideport's `link.channel` (the GS's own `radio.channel`, so it says what
  the RECEIVER is tuned to, not what the player believes); `lat` is
  p50/p99 and reads `--/--` while the anchor is cold, exactly as the
  essential rows do; the RECORDING indicator is byte-for-byte the essential
  overlay's (red dot, `REC`, mm:ss clock, `REC FAULT` in amber) because one
  aircraft should not have two recording indicators, and it is anchored
  **top-right**, alone — in a row it would have cost the bar type size and
  dragged that row off centre whenever the recorder was merely armed; and
  every item sits in a box sized for its WORST-CASE
  string, so the gaps between items are uneven and short values leave
  trailing space — that is what stops a row reflowing every time a figure
  gains a digit. The type size is likewise chosen once, for the four-card
  worst case, so a card dropping out never changes the font under the pilot.
  **The two rows exist for that type size and nothing else**: all eleven
  items on ONE line is 132 worst-case characters into 1856 px, which caps
  the type at 22 px on a 1080p panel and is too small to read on the GS
  screen. Split radio-above-picture-below the widest row is ~74 character
  advances and the same rule picks 38 px. Row 1 is the wider one, so moving
  an item between rows changes the size the whole bar renders at. The glyph atlas is
  `/usr/local/share/mabur/gs_osd.gfont`, committed and staged by
  `tools/build-arm64.sh` — if it is missing, maburplay logs the reason to
  `/tmp/maburplay.log` and runs with the MSP overlay only. Host-side you can
  see the actual pixels without hardware: `maburplay --gs-render` dumps a
  rendered frame (`--style compact|essential`, plus `--res WxH` and
  `--lat P50/P99` for the bar's player-measured fields; both styles are
  pixel-gated in `run_player_e2e.sh` PARTS D and E), `tests/test_gs_asset.cpp` gates the real asset's layout at
  720p/1080p/1440p/2160p, and `tools/bench/gs_overlay_bench.cpp` measures
  draw+quantize per update at 1080p and 2160p. Read that bench before
  changing anything on this path: it runs on the 2 ms pump loop, and the
  rule of thumb is that anything projecting past ~1.5 ms on the A55 is a
  defect. **The shipped code already reports 3.7 ms at 1080p and 9.9 ms at
  2160p for a full repaint, and that is accepted, not overlooked** — a full
  repaint is a startup/re-layout event, the quantize half of it is
  burned-DVR-only (raw or no-DVR mode pays the draw column alone: 1.3 ms and
  3.6 ms), and `ring.pump(2)` is a `poll()` ceiling over a slotted shm ring,
  so the cost lands as one-vsync-late presentation rather than a lost AU.
  What is NOT accepted is anything that puts a full repaint on a *cadence*:
  the burn restate after an MSP collision is scoped to the fields the
  collision actually hit for exactly that reason (`osd_compose.cpp`), and it
  used to cost 179,392 px per changed cell instead of ~13,000. Steady state
  is 0.13 ms.
- **Record button (GPIO).** `maburplay` can toggle the DVR from a button on
  the GS header: `input.rec` in `/etc/maburplay.toml` (`pin` is the header
  pin number, resolved at startup by matching the kernel's line names —
  the Radxa ZERO 3 names its header `PIN_7`…`PIN_40` across gpiochip1/3/4;
  `active_low`/`bias` default to a button between the pin and GND with the
  internal pull-up). Short press, 50 ms debounce, edge-triggered: each
  press-pair produces one file, in whichever `dvr.mode` is configured — raw
  mode waits for the next sync point (up to ~2 s) before the new file
  opens, so the OSD REC indicator visibly lags the press, while burned mode
  resumes at the next decoded frame. Files are `record-NNNN.mp4` under
  `dvr.dir`, indexed one past the highest `record-NNNN` already on the card
  — no timestamp, since the GS RTC is wrong at boot (same reasoning as the
  debug-log session directory's own `NNNN` index, above). The index
  therefore climbs across boots and
  never overwrites an earlier flight; date-stamped `record_<date>.mp4` files
  from before 2026-08-26 do not match the pattern, so they are ignored by
  the scan and keep their names. No `input` block means no button.
  `dvr.autostart`
  (renamed from `dvr.enabled` on 2026-08-11 — the old key now FAILS boot,
  by design) picks whether the player boots recording or armed. There is
  no config kill switch and no `--no-dvr` flag: `autostart: false` with no
  button is a player that never records. That also means a `--decode-only`
  measurement run has no CLI way to opt out of the DVR any more, so give it
  a config with `"autostart": false` — otherwise the hardware decode gate
  writes a raw file and charges SD-card I/O to the fps number. Startup logs the resolved mapping
  and every toggle logs START/STOP to `/tmp/maburplay.log`; the OSD REC
  field is the live indicator. GPIO failures (pin not found, line held by
  another consumer) are non-fatal and logged once — the player runs
  without the button.
- **The drone's encoder, up close → the localhost debug endpoint.** Since the
  2026-08-29 venc fold-in `maburd` serves three routes on
  `127.0.0.1:<venc.debug_port>` (shipped 8301), localhost-only, always on, no
  enable flag — a bind failure logs and disables itself rather than being
  fatal. It is reachable only from the drone, so `ssh root@<drone> 'wget -qO-
  http://127.0.0.1:8301/venc'`:
  - `GET /venc` → `{"req_bitrate_kbps", "ring_fill_pct", "full_drops",
    "frames"}`. `req_bitrate_kbps` is the REQUESTED rate — what RcAgent last
    successfully commanded — not a readback of what the encoder programmed;
    the key name says `req_` for that reason. `frames` advancing is the
    cheapest possible "is the camera alive" check, and the one that
    distinguishes a stalled encoder (fps flat, ring empty) from a starved link.
    There is deliberately no `qp`: this SDK has no encoder-QP readback
    (`h265Info.startQual` is 0 on every frame, no `GetChnStat` QP), and the
    key that briefly carried it on 2026-09-03 was removed the same night.
  - `GET /snapshot.jpg` → a JPEG straight off the encoder's snapshot channel
    at `venc.snapshot_quality`. Answers 503 on a build without the venc core,
    500 on a capture failure — the two are deliberately distinguishable.
  - `POST /venc/set?k=v`, whitelist `bitrate` / `qp_delta` / `roi_qp` /
    `max_ipprop` / `superframe_p_pct` (the last two are volatile encoder
    pokes, `docs/airtime-model.md` §3; `min_qp` was deleted 2026-09-03) /
    `sensor_mfps` (the genlock bench probe: the sensor's own frame rate in
    milli-fps, ±1% of the configured rate, `0` = back to it; prints a
    `> genlock:` line with the outcome; `docs/efficient-link-plan.md`
    step 2). **An
    override is not self-clearing.** RcAgent pushes a bitrate only when its
    computed value changes, so on a parked link whatever you set here holds
    until the next rung change or failsafe entry (measured: 20 s+ with no
    sign of reverting). That is what makes it a usable bench knob, and it is
    also how you wedge a flight if you forget to put it back — see
    `docs/link-adaptation.md`.

  It is a debug surface, not an instrument: nothing records it, and the same
  encoder numbers reach the GS sideport as `drone.enc.*` once per second.
  Reach for it when the GS cannot see the drone at all (`drone` is `null`, a
  half-finished deploy, no video) and you need to know whether the encoder is
  running.
- **Radio/PHY bring-up below mabur → devourer's own tools** (`rxdemo` with
  `DEVOURER_RX_ALLPATHS=1`, `doctor`, etc. — see
  `third_party/devourer/CLAUDE.md`). Use these when the question is about
  the chip/driver rather than the mabur link.
- **Bench harnesses** (`bench/linkbench`) drive special TX/RX modes for
  characterization; they are not monitoring tools. Note: the drone radio
  RX can wedge after a linkbench run — restart maburd.
- **TX-power wall calibration → `maburcal`** (`docs/calibration.md`), the
  GS-side operator CLI that replaced `bench/txagcbench` when it was
  deleted on 2026-09-10. `maburcal start` sweeps a unit's per-rate PA
  compression walls and applies them; `maburcal report <cal.log>`
  re-renders a saved run offline, which is where a run's raw per-cell
  tallies live now.

**"Wire clean" does NOT mean "no frame loss" — venc-ring vanish class,
detected since 2026-08-13.** Frames can vanish INSIDE the drone (between
the encoder and maburd's ring read — a separate waybeam process when this was
found, the in-process venc ring since the 2026-08-29 fold-in) and never get a
`frame_id`: the
wire sequence closes seamlessly over the hole, every FEC/loss counter reads
zero, and a vanished BASE frame silently smears the decoder until an IDR
(rally's natural 2 s GOP is the only healer on this build). Root cause is
CPU famine, not ring depth: above ~12 Mbps at the mcs5 bench op point the
2×A7 SoC starves maburd's hot thread (ring pinned full for 100s of ms),
so the honest knob is `encoder.bitrate_max_kbps` (`waybeam.bitrate_max_kbps`
before the fold-in renamed the section) — the bench runs 10000.
Full findings: `docs/venc-ring-vanish-findings-2026-08-12.md` (committed
with the detection port). The detection (pts-jump, EMA-period,
shed-immune) ships in maburd and exports as
`drone.enc.{vanished_base,vanished_enh,self_idr_refused}` on the sideport
(Telem wire grew 61→67, then 67→70 for the venc ring stats below, 70→83
for link-rtt, 83→84 for `roi_qp` and back to 83 the same night when the
never-filled encoder `qp` byte was dropped — a
version-mismatched pair just drops T_TELEM on CRC, so telemetry reads
absent until both ends run the same build; video is unaffected) plus a 5 s
`frame_ring:` stderr line in `/tmp/mabur.log`.

**ROI QP, no encoder QP, and the congestion-shed bit (2026-09-03).**
`drone.enc.roi_qp` is RcAgent's ROI QP *override* as commanded (signed
delta, `encoder.roi_qp_low/normal`). Until this date the same value was
exported as `drone.enc.qp`, read 0 for entire flights, and the flight-0011
analysis mistook it for "rate control never moved"
(`docs/handover-venc-overshoot-2026-09-03.md`). For a few hours that day
`drone.enc.qp` carried the encoder's `startQual` instead — which this
firmware never fills — so the key was deleted rather than shipped as a
permanent 0: **there is no encoder-QP readback on this SDK.** maburtop's
encoder row shows `roi -NN`. Alongside,
`drone.congestion_shed` (Telem flags bit4) is true while
`RcAgent::run_congestion_guard` holds any shed level — the drone-local
TxQueue-pressure / USB-failure shed (`docs/link-adaptation.md`, "Drone
congestion shed") — distinct from `failsafe_shed` (rung 0 / lost link).
A shed enh layer is silence to the GS ladder, so this bit is the only way
to attribute an enh gap to congestion rather than RF, and the only way a
bench can count sheds at all. maburtop's system row renders the pair as
`shed FS|CONG|AIR|off`. The drone `stats:` stderr line carries `enc_pk100=`,
the peak 100 ms encoder byte rate (kbit/s, decimal) inside that stats
second — the burst the 1 Hz `drone.enc.mbps` average hides — and, since
2026-09-20, `lp=`/`armed=` (see "2026-09-20 (low-power mode)" below).

**2026-09-23 (pre-FEC loss is late, not lost; and pooled).** `link.pre_fec_loss`
— the OSD's LOSS row — is the ArrivalTracker's "booked missing at the
settle line" fraction with BOTH video layers pooled in one window (until
this date it was the base layer alone); `link.ctl.pre_fec_loss` stays the
base-only sample the ladder acted on, and the player reads it only as the
fallback for a null pooled window. Booked missing means: a seq
counts missing once a later seq arrives `link.arrival_guard_syms` ahead of
it, and a symbol heard after that counts `streams[*].arr_late` and is never
un-booked. The drone's parallel USB TX pool reorders bodies on air, so at
the old compile-time guard of 32 (one FEC window) ~1 % of every burst read
as loss on a bench where `streams[*].recovered` (the symbols FEC actually
had to rebuild) was 0.008 %. Bench sweep at rung 5: guard 64 → 0.67 %, 96 →
0.23 %, 128 → 0.09 %, 192 → 0.02 % OSD loss, repairs flat. Shipped default
192 (`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`). To read real air loss use
`streams[*].recovered` + `abandoned` per second, or `fec.log`; to compare a
pre-2026-09-23 recording's `pre_fec_loss` against a new one, remember the
old number carries the artefact (`docs/data-provenance.md`).

**2026-09-23 (carrier sense on).** `drone.radio.rx = {own, foreign,
crcfail}` is the drone's own RX-side view of the channel for the last
telemetry period — the altitude view `cards[].energy` cannot give: every
frame the drone's RX callback saw, split into CRC-clean RC from this GS
(`own`), CRC-clean not-ours (`foreign`, other 802.11 on the channel) and
CRC-failed (`crcfail`, preamble heard, payload undecodable). With carrier
sense ON, `foreign + crcfail` is what the drone's transmitter deferred to.
Software counts, not the chip's CCA/FA registers — that read stalls the
drone's TX pool (`docs/cca-on-findings-2026-09-23.md`). Per period, NOT cumulative:
the exporter repeats the last Telem's values on every record until the
next one, so sample once per `drone.tlm_seq` — `flightreport.py` does
(`DRONE RX` section, silent on older recordings); `maburtop` shows them on
the drone `radio` row. `docs/cca-on-findings-2026-09-23.md`.

**2026-09-26 (VTX recorder).** `drone.rec = {state, err}` is the drone's
onboard SD recorder status, taken from `Telem.rec_status` and sent on both
sideport outputs (8300 maburtop, 8302 player OSD). `state`: 0 off,
1 recording, 2 error. `err`: 0 none, 1 Disabled (`[record] enable =
false` or ch1 failed to bind), 2 NoSlot (no `/sys/class/mmc_host/mmc*`),
3 NoCard (no `/dev/mmcblk0p1`), 4 NotMounted (`record.dir` is not a
mountpoint in `/proc/mounts`), 5 LowSpace (below `record.min_free_mb`),
6 WriteError (a write or fsync failed, so the file was closed). An error
stays until the GS wish goes off, which returns the status to `{0, 0}`.
The next on retries; the drone never retries by itself. The value is repeated on every record until the next Telem.
maburtop shows `VREC` / `VREC!<OFF|NOSLOT|NOCARD|NOMNT|FULL|WRERR>` on
the drone line. The player turns the value into the REC field's VTX leg
(`docs/vtx-recorder.md`). Recordings made before this date have no key.

**2026-09-06 (air clock).** `drone.air_backlog_max_ms` is the per-window
max of the drone's modelled air backlog (`AirClock`, spec
2026-09-06; `docs/link-adaptation.md` "Drone air clock"),
`drone.air_shed_drops` the enh AUs its admission gate has dropped since
link-up, and `drone.air_shed` (Telem flags bit5) whether it dropped any
this window — the third shed tier, below FS and CONG in maburtop's
`shed` cell; the queue row carries the backlog as `air N ms`. With
`air_clock.shed_ms` 0 (the shipped default) the model runs observe-only:
backlog reported, nothing dropped. Per frame, the same backlog rides the
SBI body header (`air_ms`, ver 2) into the AU ring (SlotHdr v3, offset
52) and the AU log's 12th column (`# aulog 3`); `tools/bench/airdrain.py
--model` compares it against the player's measured air excess.

**2026-09-20 (low-power mode).** `drone.low_power` (Telem flags bit7) is
true while the low-power operating point is in force
(`docs/link-adaptation.md`, "Low-power (disarmed) mode"). maburtop shows
`LP` in TWO places — the summary SYS row, and the DRONE panel's SoC line
(the one carrying `soc`/`radio rx`/`shed`), where it is highlighted the
same way a shed is; the compact bar tints its fps cell caution while set
(see above), but only while the sideport is fresh, since the flag is
link-sourced while the fps number is player-measured. The drone `stats:` line carries `lp=`/`armed=` and the
`rc: low_power ENTER/EXIT` lines mark transitions.

Since the venc fold-in (spec 2026-08-28) the drone also reports the
PRODUCER side of that ring, straight from `venc_get_stats()`:
`drone.enc.venc_ring_fill_pct` (0–100 occupancy at the telemetry tick) and
`drone.enc.venc_full_drops` (lifetime access units the encoder discarded
because maburd had not drained the ring). maburtop shows them as
`vring NN% drop N` on the encoder row. Read them against
`drone.enc.ring_drops`, which is the CONSUMER side of the same ring: fill
climbing with `venc_full_drops` rising means the encoder is outrunning
maburd, while `ring_drops` rising means maburd rejected slots it did read.
A *stalled* encoder shows as neither — `drone.enc.fps`/`enc_frames` simply
stop advancing.
`self_idr_refused` counts base vanishes suppressed by the IDR-adjacency
guard — the self-IDR CONSUMER is deliberately not wired: on the parked
`idr-request` branch it amplified CPU overload into an IDR storm (rolling
smear, I-frame-inflated bitrate, `air_pct` low throughout) and needs its
queued redesign (kill switch, GOP-aware suppression, rate-based guard)
before it returns. `tools/bench/ringwatch.c` (branch `bench/loss-sim-v2`)
samples the ring live when attribution is needed.
