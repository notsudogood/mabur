# Web GS — mabur ground station in the browser

`web/` is a browser page (WebUSB + WebAssembly) that runs the same receive
and ladder-control core as `maburgs`, on one RTL8812EU or RTL8812AU card, with no
native daemon involved. It supersedes the throwaway `spike/wasm/` (deleted on this
branch; branch `wasm-spike`, d54a9b2) — the spike answered "can devourer run
in Chrome over WebUSB and keep up with live video" (yes), this is that
answer turned into a real feature. Design: PR that added this page (see the
git log for `web/`); the working spec lived at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-web-gs-design.md`, which is gitignored
and machine-local, so it is not linked here — this page is meant to stand on
its own.

## What it is

A single page. GS mode runs the same channel set, boot pick/relocation and
one-card reactive hop as `maburgs`, through the shared `ChannelCore`
(`gs/src/channel_core.h`, `docs/channel-select.md`,
`docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`); no DVR on the VTX side beyond its SD
recorder, no multi-card. Local raw recording
into the browser's own storage exists (see Record, below). The page's radio
is either one USB card (WebUSB, RTL8812EU/8812AU) or the CPE510 relay
(`ws://`, see "CPE relay radio" under Use, below) — picked before Connect,
alongside the mode. Two modes, picked before Connect:

- **GS mode** — the *only* ground station for the drone. Runs rendezvous
  (DISC until DISC_ACK), the same measured-loss ladder as `maburgs`
  (probe-before-promote, fade, failsafe), and slots its RCFs into the
  drone's inter-AU idle exactly like `RcfSlotter`. Its DISC proposes the
  channel it is sent on; the link forms where the drone is found and then
  relocates once to the pick (or the pin), exactly as `maburgs` does.
- **Spotter mode** — receive, decode, display; **never transmits**. Built
  to sit next to a real `maburgs` that is already flying the link. There is
  no send path in this mode by construction (`web/src/web_gs.h`): the
  constructor drops the `Io::send` callback and neither `VrxController`
  nor `RcfSlotter` exists, so there is no code path that can build a
  control frame. A spotter starts on its start member and then follows the
  link on its own (see "Spotter follower" under Channel set).

Only one GS may command a given drone. The mode picker's own text says so
("GS mode commands the drone — only one GS per drone. Use Spotter next to a
running ground station.") — the page cannot detect a second commander and
does not try to (see Known limits).

## Build

Host build + tests (the WebGs core, `webgs` CLI, host ctest targets):

```sh
nix-shell -p pkg-config libusb1 --run "cmake -S . -B build -DDEVOURER_DIR=$PWD/../devourer && cmake --build build -j && ctest --test-dir build -R 'test_web_gs|web_au_parity'"
```

libusb for WASM (once; builds upstream libusb with the Emscripten WebUSB
backend into a repo-local `EM_CACHE` sysroot — `web/tools/build-libusb-wasm.sh`):

```sh
nix-shell -p emscripten autoconf automake libtool pkg-config --run web/tools/build-libusb-wasm.sh
```

The WASM page build (`webgs.js`/`webgs.wasm` into `web/dist/`, `www/` copied
alongside, plus the `webgs_node` replay build used by the parity gate):

```sh
nix-shell -p emscripten cmake pkg-config python3 --run "export EM_CACHE=$PWD/web/.deps/emcache; emcmake cmake -S web -B web/build-wasm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build web/build-wasm -j"
```

WASM/native parity (`web/tests/test_wasm_parity.sh`; needs both the host
`build/web/webgs` and `web/build-wasm/webgs_node.js` already built):

```sh
nix-shell -p nodejs python3 --run "BUILD=$PWD/build web/tests/test_wasm_parity.sh"
```

The page UI itself (`web/ui/`, Vite + Svelte 5, lockfile committed) is a
separate build step folded into the same WASM CMake invocation above: after
the Emscripten module is built, the standalone `web/` CMakeLists also runs
`npm ci` (when the lockfile changed) and `npm run build` (`vite build`) in
`web/ui`, writing the page's JS/CSS bundle into `web/dist` next to
`webgs.js`/`webgs.wasm`. It needs `nodejs` in the shell alongside
`emscripten`:

```sh
nix-shell -p emscripten cmake pkg-config python3 nodejs --run "export EM_CACHE=$PWD/web/.deps/emcache; emcmake cmake -S web -B web/build-wasm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build web/build-wasm -j"
```

For UI-only iteration, `npm run dev` in `web/ui` (inside `nix-shell -p
nodejs`) runs Vite's dev server, serving `webgs.js`/`webgs.wasm` straight out
of `web/dist` (build that once via the CMake step above) with the same
COOP/COEP headers the static server sets — no rebuild-the-WASM-module round
trip for a page-only change.

Page logic tests (session lifecycle, config form, rec state, hitch/stat
math, segment alignment, layout) — pass the files explicitly, a bare
directory argument fails on this machine's Node 22:

```sh
nix-shell -p nodejs --run "node --test web/tests/*.test.mjs"
```

**The OPFS sink** (`web/src/opfs_file.h`/`.cpp`, page build only). Local
recording writes through `OpfsFile`, which holds `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle`s
on the core pthread — the dedicated Worker where that API exists —
opened/removed with `EM_ASYNC_JS` (awaited through ASYNCIFY, called only from
the core loop, never from inside an AU callback) and written synchronously
thereafter. A startup probe (`opfs_probe()`) creates, writes, checks and
removes a throwaway file once at module start and prints `webgs: opfs
ok|unavailable`, gating whether local recording is offered at all. This is
**not WASMFS**: `-sWASMFS` (Emscripten 4.0.12) makes `fcntl(F_SETFL,
O_NONBLOCK)` return `EINVAL`, which breaks the WebUSB libusb backend's
`libusb_init` — so the page keeps its ordinary Emscripten filesystem and
talks to OPFS directly instead. `webgs_node` and the native `webgs` CLI keep
the plain `FILE*` `DvrSink` (`common/dvr_mux.h`) both raw DVR paths share.

## Serve

**Hosted: <https://gilankpam.github.io/mabur/>** (stable) and
**<https://gilankpam.github.io/mabur/edge/>** (edge) — the simplest way in,
and the only one that works on a phone without extra setup. The `Pages`
workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) builds the WASM core and the page
whenever a change touches `web/`, `gs/src/`, `gs/bundle/` or `common/`, and
pushes `web/dist` into the `gh-pages` branch (Pages source: deploy from a
branch). A `master` push (or a manual Actions → Pages → Run workflow on master;
any other ref goes to edge)
rewrites the site root and leaves `edge/` alone; a push to any same-repo PR
rewrites `edge/` only, so edge is whichever PR pushed last. The edge page
says `edge #PR sha` next to the brand. Both channels are one origin, so
they share the WebUSB grant, `localStorage` settings and the OPFS
recordings. It is real HTTPS on a public certificate, so no
local CA is needed on any device. GitHub Pages cannot send the COOP/COEP
headers WASM pthreads need, so
`web/ui/sw/sw.js` (built into `web/dist/sw.js`; based on coi-serviceworker,
MIT) is a service worker that adds them — the very first visit reloads the
page once. The same worker makes the page **work offline**: on install it
precaches every file of that build (list injected at build time by
`web/ui/sw/plugin.mjs` from Vite's bundle + `public/` + `webgs.{js,wasm}`).
If any single file fails to precache, the whole install fails (a per-file
warning is still logged): the previous worker and its complete cache stay in
control, and the browser retries the install on a later navigation, rather
than an incomplete cache going live and offline-failing on whichever file
never made it in. Same-origin requests then get one of three fetch
strategies (`fetchStrategy()`, `web/ui/sw/plugin.mjs`), picked per request so
a gh-pages deploy that deletes old hashed files can never serve a stale
`index.html` alongside a 404ing asset: hashed build assets (`assets/…`) are
**cache-first** (cached copy if present, else network); a **navigation**
(loading the page itself) is network-first with a 3 s timeout, falling back
to the cache on a slow or failed network; everything else (`webgs.js`,
`webgs.wasm`, `font_btfl.png`, …) is network-first with **no** timeout,
falling back to the cache on a network error or a non-ok response (e.g. a
mismatched `webgs.wasm` 404ing against a fresher `webgs.js`) when a cached
copy exists. So: open the hosted page once with internet; afterwards it
loads with none (e.g. a laptop whose only network is the CPE). Online visits
always get the latest deploy; reload while online to pick one up. Stable and
edge keep separate caches (`mabur:<scope>:<build id>`). A page still
controlled by the old vendored coi worker registers the new one on its next
visit (`shouldRegister()`). The WebUSB grant is per origin, so each device
picks the card once on this site. The page is the bundle-default ladder
build, same as a local one.

**Install as an app.** The page is an installable PWA: Chrome's menu
(Android: "Add to Home screen" / "Install app"; desktop: the install icon
in the address bar) installs it. `web/ui/public/manifest.webmanifest`
launches it `display: fullscreen`, `orientation: landscape`, with relative
`start_url`/`scope`, so each channel installs as its own app (`/mabur/` and
`/mabur/edge/`) and a local `serve.py` build is installable too. The
manifest and icons sit in `public/`, so the offline precache above carries
them; an installed app opens offline exactly like the tab. Launched
installed, the phone overlay drops its Fullscreen button and Connect skips
the `requestFullscreen` + `orientation.lock` step
(`matchMedia('(display-mode: fullscreen)')`, `App.svelte`): the window is
already fullscreen, while `document.fullscreenElement` stays null there.
Icons: `web/ui/icons/icon.svg` (the design handoff's mark) and
`icon-maskable.svg` (full-bleed background, glyph scaled 0.8 into the
maskable safe zone) are the sources; the PNGs in `public/` are committed
renders (`rsvg-convert` then `oxipng --strip all`, `nix-shell -p librsvg
oxipng`), `favicon.svg` is the handoff's simplified small-size mark.
`web/tests/pwa.test.mjs` pins the manifest fields, the icon sizes and that
every linked file is precached. Benched headless (Chrome 147, 2026-09-30):
no installability errors, all 7 files in the worker cache, button gate
correct; a real phone install is untested.

`web/serve.py` is a static server for `web/dist` that sets the COOP/COEP
headers WASM pthreads need (`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`,
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`).

**Localhost** (Chrome only — see Known limits for why): `python3
web/serve.py 8808`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8808/`. Plain HTTP is a
secure context only on `localhost`, which is enough for a card plugged into
the same machine running Chrome.

**LAN (a phone, or any browser that isn't on the serving machine)** needs
HTTPS: WebUSB and `SharedArrayBuffer` both require a secure context, and a
click-through on a bare self-signed cert is **not** enough — the bypass
covers the tab, but Emscripten's pthread pool is workers spawned from a
worker, and those workers' script fetches still fail the certificate check
("worker sent an error! undefined:undefined: undefined" — `app.js` maps
that to the "Page worker failed" banner). The certificate has to be
genuinely trusted:

```sh
nix-shell -p openssl --run ./web/mkcert.sh   # local CA (once, reused) + server cert
python3 web/serve.py 8808 0.0.0.0 --tls
```

`mkcert.sh` writes `web/tls/` (gitignored): a local CA, name-constrained to
`localhost` and the private IPv4 ranges (so trusting it can never vouch for
a public site), and a server cert signed by it covering `localhost` plus
every IPv4 this host currently has. Re-running it reuses an existing
`tls/ca.key` rather than minting a new CA. **On this machine the CA already
sitting in `web/tls/` is the one from the `spike/wasm/` days, moved here
verbatim** — it is already trusted in this host's Chrome NSS database under
the nickname `mabur-spike-ca` (not `mabur-webgs-ca`; that is only the name
`mkcert.sh`'s own comment suggests for a *new* install). Install the CA on
each viewing device before opening the page there:

- **Android**: Settings > Security > Encryption & credentials > Install a
  certificate > CA certificate, pick `web/tls/ca.crt`.
- **Linux Chrome**: `certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "C,," -n
  mabur-webgs-ca -i web/tls/ca.crt` (use a fresh nickname for a device that
  has never trusted it before; `nix-shell -p nssTools` if `certutil` is
  missing; remove with `certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -D -n
  mabur-webgs-ca`), then restart Chrome.

Then open `https://<host-ip>:8808/`. WebUSB's device grant is per browser
origin, so the card chooser asks again on the new `https://` origin even if
`http://127.0.0.1` already had a grant.

**NixOS firewall**, if the LAN device can't reach the port:
`sudo iptables -I nixos-fw -p tcp --dport 8808 -j nixos-fw-accept` (lost on
firewall reload — not persistent).

## Use

Pick a mode, a channel set and width, press Connect. The page defaults to
**Spotter** mode (URL `?mode=` or the last-used choice override it) — a
deliberate safety default, although the design spec named `gs`: opening
the page must never start commanding a drone that a `maburgs` or another
tab may already be flying; GS mode is an explicit opt-in.

### Channel set

The Config form's radio group is a **Channels** chip row (1–8 members of
the 5 GHz list, `CHANNELS` in `web/ui/src/lib/config.js`, plus any member
outside it — `chipChannels()` — so every member can be removed) and a **Link
channel** select: **Auto** (measure the set, hop to the cleanest) or one
member, which pins the link to it. URL params override the saved form on
load: `?chs=40,64` sets the set, `?ch=N` pins N (added to the set, kept
sorted, when absent and there is room), `?ch=auto` unpins. On Connect the form goes to
the core as the overlay's `[radio]` table — `channels = [...]`,
`channel = "auto"|N` and `width` — in **both** modes (`toOverlayToml()`), so
the core's loader checks the set at the page's width (not the bundle's 40:
a 20 MHz set like `[165]` would otherwise fail `ERROR bad config`).

`--ch` is "start on this member" (`startChannel()`): the pin when there is
one, else the remembered member — `localStorage` `webgs.channel`, written
from the core's `CHANNEL <n>` stdout lines, which the glue prints on every
change of the plan's op (`ChannelCore`'s store, `store_name` `CHANNEL
line`) — when it is still in the set, else the first member. In GS mode
the link then forms where the drone is found and relocates once to the
pick (or the pin), and — in Auto — the one-card reactive hop runs on top,
exactly as in `maburgs`; a pinned member is static
(`docs/channel-select.md`, `docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`). Pinned by
`test_web_gs`'s `gs_one_card_auto_hops_on_interference_but_pinned_never`:
the same interference that makes the Auto rig order a one-card hop leaves
the pinned rig on its member with `hop.state` idle, `hops`/`holds` 0 and
the verdict still reading `interfered` for the page.
The scan/hop knobs are the bundle defaults (`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml`);
the form does not expose them. A spotter starts on its start member and
follows from there ("Spotter follower" below).

The set is validated twice. Page-side, `checkChannelSet()` (a mirror of
`common/include/mabur/channel_set.h`'s rules plus the pin rule: 1–8
members, each 1–177, no duplicates, at 40 MHz every member on an HT40 pair
and all on one side of the pair grid, the pin a member) runs in
`connectBlocker()` before the device is requested. There is no per-radio
channel rule: the CPE relay tunes the whole 20 MHz grid 36–177, channel 144
included, since `mabur-openwrt` 2c1c51f (2026-10-03, `docs/cpe510-relay.md`);
the page's earlier "cannot tune 144" refusal was stale and was removed.
Core-side, `webgs::channel_width_error` re-checks with `maburgs`'s own
loader checks: the set rules, the start channel a member, pinned ⇒ start ==
the pin, and in GS mode no 40 MHz rung at width 20 (the GS could not
receive it). A core refusal reads `Channel/width refused: <reason>` (core
line `ERROR bad channel/width: <reason>`).

While live, the header shows the live channel (the core's `channel`) with
`scanning` (scout running, `scan_state` `scouting`), `moving` (the
relocation) or `hop` (a hop in flight) after it; disconnected it shows the
form's link channel or `auto`; a spotter shows `following` or `sweeping`
while it is not locked. The Debug tab's **Channel** group carries
the channel, scan state/rounds/pick, hop state/verdict, hop target/epoch
and hops/holds (a spotter shows the channel and its follow state, see
"Spotter follower"). The core's
`maburgs channel: …` / `maburgs hop: …` stderr lines appear verbatim in the
browser console log.

### Spotter follower

A spotter has no control link, so it cannot be told where the link is;
it listens for it. `webgs::SpotterFollow` (`web/src/spotter_follow.{h,cpp}`,
spec 2026-10-04 §6) runs in the core on the spotter's one card:

- **Sweeping** — round-robin over the channel set, 150 ms per member
  counted from when the card reports it is on the member (a USB
  FastRetune is immediate; a CPE relay TUNE reports tuned after 50 ms,
  measured 2026-10-04);
  the first CRC-good mabur frame on a member locks. A member the card
  never reports (a relay that cannot tune it) is skipped after 1 s. The
  spotter starts here, on its start member.
- **Locked** — every frame on the channel refreshes a 1 s silence timer;
  silence sweeps again from the next member. The real GS's RCFs carry
  its standing hop order (`hop_ch`/`hop_epoch`) in the clear; a new pair
  naming another member → **Following**. Locked means hearing any mabur
  traffic on the channel — the GS's own DISC search bursts included —
  not video: with the drone off, a spotter sits locked wherever the GS
  is beaconing, and sweeps again within ~1 s once the GS links elsewhere
  and stops beaconing.
- **Following** — the card retunes to the target; a frame there locks
  (`follows` counts every order acted on — confirmed, retargeted,
  withdrawn or timed out — so one hop that was retargeted once reads
  `follows 2`). Nothing on the target within 2 s (the drone's
  own `move_confirm_ms`) → back to the previous channel, with a fresh
  silence window. A withdrawal heard before the card moved returns at
  once; the same pair repeated is ignored (so a standing order after a
  timeout cannot ping-pong).

The RCF tag is **not verified** on a spotter (user decision 2026-10-04):
it cannot be in general (the tag's `seq32` wrap count is private to the
two link ends), and the pairing design defends the aircraft, not a
display — a forged order drags a spotter off-channel for at most 2 s.
No key is read in spotter mode. A move resets nothing in the video path:
the FrameStream closes the gap as truncated AUs and the decoder re-arms
on the next IRAP (see "Spotter key frames"). STATS carries
`follow_state` (`locked` | `following` | `sweeping`) and `follows`; the
header shows the state word after the width while not locked, and the
Debug tab's Channel group shows `channel` and `follow`. Spotter mode
still never transmits.

### CPE relay radio

The radio picker on the Disconnected screen offers **USB card** (default) or
**CPE relay** — a TP-Link CPE510 running `mabur-relay` protocol v4
(`docs/cpe510-relay.md`), reached over WebSocket instead of a locally
plugged-in card; no card chooser, no WebUSB grant.

**Address.** The CPE firmware puts the relay at **`10.83.11.1`**
(mabur-openwrt `90-mabur-lan`, DHCP for the client — `docs/cpe510-relay.md`),
so Connect uses `10.83.11.1:8311` (`RELAY_DEFAULT`) with no address field on
screen. Each Connect probes exactly one address (`connectRelay()`,
`web/ui/src/lib/relay_connect.js`): open `ws://<addr>`, send HELLO, wait
≤ 1.5 s for any mabur v4 message. No reply → *"No CPE relay found at
10.83.11.1 — …, or enter its address."* and the address field appears. A
typed address is saved (`webgs.last.relayCustom`), keeps the field visible
on later visits, and is then the **only** address Connect tries; clearing it
returns to the default and hides the field from the next visit.

**Hosted page works; relay host must be a private IP; one-time prompt.**
An `https://` page normally cannot open a plain `ws://` socket (mixed
content), and the relay doesn't speak `wss://` (see `docs/cpe510-relay.md`,
"Why not wss"). Chrome's Local Network Access (LNA) changes both halves,
measured 2026-09-29 on Chrome 147 against the bench CPE from the real
`gilankpam.github.io` origin:

- **Mixed content:** `ws://` to a **private IP literal** or a **`.local`
  name** is exempt (console: "Insecure access is deprecated"). A public DNS
  name that resolves to the LAN is still blocked outright. So on an
  `https:` origin `relayBlocker()` accepts a private/loopback/link-local
  IPv4 literal or a `.local` name (`isLocalRelayHost()`) and refuses the
  rest with *"On the hosted page the relay address must be a private IP
  (e.g. 10.83.11.1) or a .local name."*
- **Permission:** a public page reaching a private address needs the
  `local-network` permission. Until it is granted Chrome holds the socket
  on a one-time "local network access" prompt (headed: still pending after
  12 s); headless, or denied, it dies with close 1006. Granting
  `local-network` via CDP made the same socket open from both the page and
  a Worker; the older `local-network-access` name does not unblock it.
  Chrome's LNA blog post still says WebSockets are "not yet gated" — stale.
- **Connect waits for the prompt.** The core gives up on an unopened relay
  in ~2 s, which would fail the session underneath the prompt. On `https:`
  `connectRelay()` queries `local-network` first: `granted` probes with the
  1.5 s timeout, `denied` errors with a site-settings hint, `prompt` lets the
  probe socket itself raise the prompt and waits up to 60 s. A browser with
  no `local-network` permission (Firefox, Chrome < 142) just probes; its
  not-found text then also names the browser block and the local page.

A spoofed-origin test (github.io mapped to a LAN address) is **not**
evidence here: that page is itself private, so Chrome skips the LNA check.
Test against the real hosted origin.

**What Connect does.** The page opens a dedicated Worker
(`web/ui/src/lib/relay_worker.js`) that owns the WebSocket, bridged to the
WASM core through a `SharedArrayBuffer` ring pair (`web/src/relay_ring.h` /
`web/ui/src/lib/relay_ring.js`, byte-identical twins pinned by shared golden
tests — see Design, below) so the socket and its GC/render-thread neighbors
never delay an RCF. The core builds a `maburgs::RemoteCard`
(`gs/src/remote_card.{h,cpp}`, the same card class `maburgs` runs for
`radio.relays`) over that ring (`web/src/relay_ring_transport.h`), with
`Cfg::restart_when_refused` off. Its `RelayClient` does the same HELLO/TUNE
dance as natively (`docs/cpe510-relay.md`): HELLO every 500 ms, TUNE
retried every 500 ms while not owner (only within the first 2.5 s), and —
once owner but the relay reads back mistuned — TUNE retried every 500 ms
indefinitely. **Both modes own the relay** (one relay, one client — spec
2026-10-04 §1): Connect waits for `RemoteCard::health()` to read `Owned`
before the session starts, in GS mode and in Spotter mode alike.

**Search-only scout on the relay.** With no USB card, the core's boot
scout runs on the relay with search bursts only (spec §3.7): DISC goes out
on each member in turn, but the CPE has no energy reads, so no member is
ever ranked and the stats' `scan_state` reads `off`. Auto on a relay means
"start member plus search". This is **boot only**: once linked, the page
drives the same `ChannelCore` `maburgs` does (`docs/channel-select.md`
"Where the code lives"; bench §"Channel set, relocation, one-card hop —
bench 2026-10-04 (plan 2)" below), and since protocol v4 (2026-10-05,
`docs/cpe510-relay.md` "Interference + hop on a relay") a relay-only page
gets the full in-flight verdict → sweep → ranker → hop flow too — it sends
a `SCAN` for the channel set, ranks the `SCAN_RESULT`, and hops exactly as
`maburgs` does. The boot scout's own search-only limit (no member ever
ranked at boot) is unchanged; only the in-flight path gained a ranking
source for the relay.

**Errors** (core `ERROR` line → page text, `errorText()` in
`web/ui/src/lib/logic.mjs`), driven by `RemoteCard::health()` — the same
five texts as before, in both modes:

- `relay unreachable` — no `STATUS` within 2 s → *"CPE relay not reachable
  — check the Ethernet cable and the relay address, then press Connect."*
- `relay owned by another client` — still not owner 2.5 s after
  connecting (a spotter too, since both modes own the relay) → *"CPE relay is owned by another client (maburgs or another
  tab). Stop it, wait 2 s, then press Connect."*
- `relay cannot tune` — owner, but the relay isn't on our channel/width
  2.5 s after connecting (e.g. a regdomain that refuses the channel) →
  *"CPE relay could not tune to this channel/width — check the channel is
  allowed on the CPE (regulatory domain), then press Connect."*
- `relay lost` — `STATUS` stopped arriving, or the socket closed, after a
  successful connect → *"CPE relay connection lost. Press Connect to
  restart."*
- `relay taken by another client` — after owning the relay
  (`owned_and_tuned()` true at least once): a `STATUS` says `you_own == 0`
  and keeps saying so for >= 1 s straight (e.g. a UDP subscriber — native
  `webgs --relay`, a running `maburgs` with `radio.relays` — takes ownership away; the relay
  prefers the oldest UDP subscriber) → *"Another client took over the CPE
  relay (maburgs or another tab). Stop it, then press Connect."* Distinct
  from `relay owned by another client`, which fires before ownership was
  ever won.

**One owner, both modes.** A spotter no longer listens on a relay it does
not own: the page is one client of the relay whichever mode it runs, so a
spotter needs ownership exactly as GS mode does, and `relay owned by
another client` / `relay taken by another client` fire for it too. A
spotter next to a `maburgs` that already holds the relay cannot share it —
give the spotter a USB card instead.

**Relay stats group** (Stats tab, shown only when `radio: 'relay'`):
channel/width (or "retuning" when `relay_state == 1`, mid-TUNE), owner
(`you_own`, yes/no — this client holds the relay), tuned (`relay_owned`,
`owned_and_tuned()`, yes/no — owner AND on our channel/width; the two can
disagree, e.g. right after another client takes ownership), frames, seq
gaps, ring drops rx/tx (the `SharedArrayBuffer` ring, not the relay
itself), TX / fail / refused (mirrors the relay's own `STATUS`
counters), and your drops (the relay's own `your_drops` — frames it had
to drop for this client specifically, e.g. a full send queue). The keys
are unchanged (`relay_you_own`, …); the ring drops now come from
`RemoteCard::relay_stats()`. The USB-only
rows elsewhere on the Debug tab (usb latency, txfail) are hidden for the
relay radio — they have no relay equivalent. The general stats line also
carries `radio: "usb"|"relay"` so log/replay tooling can tell which path a
session used.

**Native bench equivalent:** `webgs live --relay host:port` (default UDP
port **8310**, not the browser's WebSocket 8311) runs the same
`RemoteCard` over UDP as a CLI, used for the A/B bench numbers in
`docs/cpe510-relay.md`'s TX mode section.

This page's ladder starts from whatever `web/CMakeLists.txt` embeds into the
WASM module at build time — the bundle default,
`gs/bundle/maburgs.default.toml` (5 rungs, all 40 MHz, top = rung 4
mcs4/40) — not a GS's own tuned `/etc/maburgs.toml`; the Config form (below)
overrides it per session. A GS box on the same drone may run a different
(e.g. mcs-wider or narrower) ladder; don't read this page's rung numbers as
if they were that GS's unless the form was left at its defaults.

**Connect/Disconnect are in-page** — no reload to change mode, channel set,
width or (GS mode) the ladder, and no reload between flights.
`Session` (`web/ui/src/lib/session.js`) drives a small state machine
(`idle → connecting → live → stopping → idle`, plus `error`): Connect
requests the device, builds a **fresh** WASM module every time (never
reused across connects) with `--mode`/`--ch`/`--w` and, in both modes
always (even when the form matches the embedded default), `--overlay
/overlay.toml` (the form's overlay TOML written into the module's virtual
FS before `main()` runs; a spotter's carries `[radio]` plus a minimal
one-rung `[link]` at the page width).
Disconnect calls the exported `webgs_stop()`, which sets an atomic the core
loop polls; the core tears down cleanly and returns from `main()`, and
`-sEXIT_RUNTIME` fires `Module.onExit()`, which the page treats as the
signal that the module is gone and the UI can go back to `idle` (or
straight into a new Connect). If `onExit` doesn't arrive within 3 s
(`stopTimeoutMs`), the page treats that as the module being stuck rather
than waiting indefinitely: it reloads the page as a fallback, landing back
on the Config tab. Recording is stopped first if it was on (see Record,
below) before the stop request goes out.

WebUSB has no transfer cancel (libusb's emscripten backend `cancel` is a
no-op), so on a quiet channel — drone off, nothing on air — the RX loop's
pending `transferIn` calls would never complete and the core could not
exit. The dance lives in `RadioFrontend::stop()` under `__EMSCRIPTEN__`
(`gs/src/radio_frontend.cpp`): it waits 300 ms for the RX loop to end on
its own; if it hasn't, it releases interface 0, which makes Chrome abort
those reads (they surface in the console as `NetworkError: ... A transfer
error has occurred`), joins the RX thread, re-claims the interface for the
chip's power-down writes, and continues. It prints one line per stop, on
stderr: `maburgs radio card 0: teardown rx <ms> [(reads aborted)]`. A stop
requested while the card is still initialising (~5 s after Connect) takes
effect only once init finishes.

The browser's own device
chooser asks for the card — an RTL8812EU (Jaguar3), an RTL8812AU
(Jaguar1), or a TP-Link RTL8821AU (Jaguar1 1T1R: Archer T2U Plus
2357:0120, plus 011e/0122 — the chooser filters on vendors 0bda and 2357,
the core on exact VID:PID — `web_main.cpp`'s `kCards`, handed to
`RadioFrontend::Cfg::ids`); the WASM core builds both devourer drivers (WebUSB's per-origin
device grant — pick it once and later `getDevices()` calls see it without asking again on the same
origin).

**The RTL8821AU cannot decode LDPC**, and the drone codes every frame
(video, probe, DISC_ACK, telemetry, MSP) with LDPC by default, so with this
card the page sees only CRC-failed bodies and never links. Set
`[radio] ldpc = false` in the drone's `/etc/mabur.toml` (config before
binary, `docs/deploy.md`) to fly BCC instead. That costs every GS the LDPC
coding gain (2-3 dB measured at the same MCS), so set it back to `true`
when flying an 8812EU/AU GS. Bench 2026-10-02, ch 136 HT20, 1000 x 1400 B
MCS0 from an 8812EU into the 8821AU: plain 900+, STBC 900+, LDPC 1,
LDPC+STBC 0 received. The 8821AU's own uplink, LDPC included, decodes fine
at an 8812EU (600-700+), and STBC on its RX side is fine; devourer drops
the STBC flag on its TX (one chain) and logs a one-time warning.

What the status overlay shows after that:

- `Starting…` / `Requesting device…` — module bring-up, before the core
  loop is up.
- `No drone on ch N / W MHz (still trying)` — GS mode, no DISC_ACK within
  10 s of module start; it keeps sending DISC and the message keeps
  counting, it does not give up.
- `Searching for drone on ch N / W MHz…` (GS, no DISC_ACK yet, first 10 s)
  and `Waiting for video…` (GS after the ack, or spotter) — shown only
  until the first frame of this Connect is decoded, while the screen is
  still black (`VideoPipeline.hasPicture`, cleared by `reset()`).
- After the first frame, no overlay text covers the video while the
  key-frame gate is unarmed — a freeze holds the last frame and GS mode
  requests an IDR instead of waiting; see "Key-frame recovery" below.
  A spotter has no request path and can still sit unarmed indefinitely; see
  "Spotter key frames" below.
- `GS mode keeps flying the link while this tab is hidden.` — a one-time
  banner (GS mode only) confirming the ladder and RCF sends do not pause
  when the tab loses visibility; the worker keeps running headless.
- `Card busy — maburgs or another tab has it. Close that and press
  Connect.` / `No RTL8812EU/8812AU/8821AU card found — plug it in and press
  Connect.` / `Card lost (unplugged?). Press Connect to restart.` /
  `WebUSB unavailable in this browser.` / `Unsupported card chip.` — mapped
  from the core's `ERROR <reason>` lines (`web/ui/src/lib/logic.mjs`'s
  `errorText()`); Connect re-enables so trying again costs nothing.
- `Page worker failed — if served over LAN, the TLS CA is not trusted on
  this device (see docs/web-gs.md).` — the untrusted-cert failure mode
  above; that is this file.

### Key-frame recovery (spec 2026-09-28)

The gate arms only on an IRAP, and the drone's periodic refresh is GDR, so
after a DISCONT or a decoder error the page cannot heal on its own. In GS
mode it asks: `IdrRequester` (logic.mjs) fires on the drop and every 300 ms
while unarmed, `Module._webgs_request_idr()` bumps a count whose low byte
rides every RCF as `idr_epoch`, and RcAgent serves one paced IDR per
change. Expected freeze ≈ 150 ms (≈ 450 ms if the IDR itself is lost). A
spotter cannot ask and waits for the next drone-side IDR. No text is drawn
over the video while frozen; the debug panel's `IDR req` row is the page's
own request count. (Until the 2026-09-30 telem diet it was an `IDR req /
served` pair against Telem `idr_gs`; the page sees for itself whether a
key frame arrived, so the drone's count left the wire.)

`IdrRequester` never asks when `VideoDecoder` doesn't exist in this
browser (final review, 2026-09-28) -- no request fixes a missing codec API.
It also backs off: a key chunk that fails to decode (unsupported codec
rejected by `configure()`, a reclaimed hardware decoder, or the hvcC racing
its own key AU at stream start) doubles the retry interval each time,
300 ms → 600 ms → … capped at 4.8 s, and a normal mid-stream error that
follows an actual decoded frame (the missing-reference case this feature
exists for) never backs off. Without this, a device that simply can't
decode HEVC would have asked the drone for a fresh IDR -- the biggest frame
on the link -- about 3.3 times a second for the whole flight.

`IDR req` is this page's own count since the current Connect. The drone
collapses multiple `idr_epoch` bumps that land within one RCF interval into
a single IDR, so a burst of asks legitimately yields fewer key frames than
requests.

**Spotter key frames.** WebCodecs will only start decoding on a real IRAP
(IRAP NAL types 16–21: BLA/IDR/CRA), never on the drone's GDR parameter-set refresh
(`32 33 34 1`, TRAIL_R). The drone emits a real IDR unsolicited on a rung
change, link-up, or chain break, and — in GS mode only — on request (see
"Key-frame recovery" above). Spotter mode has no request path, so a
spotter opened mid-flight on a steady link can sit unarmed until one of
those unsolicited IDRs happens to land — there is no drone, wire or config
change to force one (see Follow-ups). GS mode does not have this gap: on
first link a self-linking GS's own link-up already produces a key frame
roughly a second after DISC_ACK (linking a previously-unlinked drone
changes its bitrate, max-range floor → rung, and that `SetChnAttr` costs
an IDR on its own), and any later drop is covered by the request path
above. The same applies after a follower move (a sweep find or a followed
hop): the spotter waits for the drone's next unsolicited IDR on the new
channel — a followed hop usually gets one soon, since the drone's retune
and the GS's post-hop rung change both cost an IDR, but nothing on the
spotter can ask for it.

## Config form

The Config tab (`web/ui/src/components/ConfigPanel.svelte`, and
`ConfigSide.svelte` for the immersive/mobile layout) edits the channel set,
the link channel and width in both modes (see "Channel set" under Use),
plus — GS mode only — Fixed MCS (`static_mcs`, −1 = adaptive), the
"Retransmit (NACK)" switch (`[link.nack] enable`, default on; see
"Software NACK" below) and the
ladder rungs (mcs/bw/FEC overhead per rung, add/
remove up to 8, drag the ⋮⋮ handle — or focus it and use ↑/↓ — to reorder;
`applyRungEdit(cfg, from, '__move', to)`). `web/ui/src/lib/config.js` normalizes and persists the
form to `localStorage` under `webgs.cfg` (per-field fallback to the bundle
default, so a stale or hand-edited entry can never break the page), and
`?chs=`/`?ch=`/`?w=` query params override the saved set, link channel and
width on load the same way `?mode=` overrides the saved mode. On Connect,
the form (always, even when it matches the embedded default) is serialized
to TOML (`toOverlayToml()`: `[radio] channels/channel/width` in both modes, and
in GS mode `[link] static_mcs/static_bw/max_mcs`, a `[link.nack]
enable = true|false` table (the bundle's other NACK keys stay), plus one
`[[link.ladder]]` block per rung, `static_bw` carrying the form's width,
`max_mcs` always 7 — the form has no Max MCS since 2026-09-29, the ladder
as listed is the whole policy) and
handed to the core as `--overlay /overlay.toml`. While Fixed MCS is
pinned the form hides the ladder, and the overlay sends a single `{mcs = static_mcs, bw = width}` rung instead
of the saved ladder (the loader validates the ladder even when pinned — a
40 MHz rung at width 20 would fail boot — and the user can't see those
fields to fix them); `connectBlocker()` skips the ladder checks likewise,
and the saved ladder comes back untouched with Adaptive; `maburgs::load_config`'s
`overlay_path` argument (`gs/src/config.h`/`.cpp`) deep-merges it over the
embedded `maburgs.default.toml` (an overlay `[[link.ladder]]` replaces the
file's ladder whole, it does not append) and re-runs the same validation
the native loader runs. A rejected overlay surfaces as `ERROR bad config:
<reason>` from the core; `connectBlocker()` mirrors the same checks
page-side (channel/width, FEC overhead range 0.1–2.0, enh ≤ base, no 40 MHz rung under a 20 MHz width) so a bad
form is refused before Connect ever starts the device request, and a
per-field warning (`rungWarnings()`/`channelWarning()`) flags a 40 MHz rung
under a 20 MHz width, enh above base, or a channel with no HT40 pair without blocking the rest of
the form. Spotter mode's overlay carries `[radio]` plus a fixed minimal
`[link]` (`static_bw` and one MCS 0 rung at the page width, so the loader's
ladder-vs-width check passes at 20 MHz) — it only listens, so only the
channel set, link channel and width apply.

## Record

One Record button drives up to two recorders, picked by the Config form's
DVR target (`sessionCfg.dvr`, `web/ui/src/lib/localrec.js`'s
`DVR_TARGETS`): `web` (local browser recording, the default), `vtx` (the
drone's onboard SD recorder), or `both`. The target is editable only while
disconnected — it takes a fresh Connect to change what one press covers,
same as channel/width. Spotter mode has no send path, so `effectiveTarget()`
forces it to `web` regardless of the saved config, and the target control
shows VTX/Both disabled with the reason.

**VTX target.** Unchanged: `Session.setRec()` calls the exported
`webgs_set_rec(1|0)`; the core (`WebGs::set_vtx_rec`, `web/src/web_gs.h`/
`.cpp`) sets the RCF's recorder wish byte the same way `maburgs` does
(`kRecKnown | kRecOn`), so the drone's onboard VTX SD recorder starts/stops
exactly as it would under a native GS (`docs/vtx-recorder.md`). The VTX part
of the indicator follows the drone's own report, not the click: it reads
`Telem.rec_status` back off the stats stream (core `rec_state`/`rec_err`
keys) and only counts as "recording" once the drone confirms it. Disconnect
in GS mode with the wish still on sends the "off" RCF and waits up to 1 s
(`recOffTimeoutMs`) for the drone to confirm `rec_state != 1` before stopping
the module, so a Disconnect doesn't leave the VTX recording with nothing
left to turn it off.

**Local (`web`) target.** `RawDvr` (`common/raw_dvr.h`, shared with
`maburplay`'s raw DVR mode — see `docs/observability.md`) runs on the core
thread, fed every AU in `io.on_au` before the page hand-off. Its sync point
is the first *complete* IRAP (`au_is_irap()`, in practice an IDR) once
VPS+SPS+PPS are known — and only IRAPs are marked sync inside the file.
Arming also bumps the GS-requested IDR counter, so pressing Record shows
the button label `waiting for sync…` for about one request round trip
until that IDR arrives and `RawDvr` starts muxing samples into the file.
**Before 2026-09-29** the sync point was any AU carrying VPS+SPS+PPS — the
GDR encoder's TRAIL_R refresh start every `gop_s`, a P slice. Such files
begin on a P slice and flag every refresh start sync; ffmpeg decodes them
but Apple's decoder (QuickTime, VLC on macOS) refuses the file, and their
fragment seams could step the timeline up to ~130 ms backwards. Repair
recipe for those files: drop fragments before the first IRAP, re-flag
sync = IRAP only, and rewrite tfdt as the running sum of trun durations. It IS armed before that point, though: the
(empty) OPFS file is created and opened right at the press
(`OpfsFile::open()`, see Build, above), wrapped as a `DvrSink` (`OpfsSink`
in `web_main.cpp`) and held by `RawDvr` while it waits for the sync AU; a
press-then-release inside the window leaves it empty, and the core removes
it (rather than reporting a 0-byte download) when it seals. `open()` never
overwrites an existing non-empty file — a same-second name collision (or a
leftover file from an earlier session) fails the start with "cannot create
file" instead of truncating it. Files are named `mabur-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.mp4`
(`recFileName()`, browser local clock, `-2`/`-3` suffix chosen against the
already-listed recordings) and created directly in the OPFS root.

`Module.onRecClosed(name, bytes, err)` fires once per recording, on every
way it can end: an explicit stop, a `RawDvr::Error` (sticky, surfaces once),
Disconnect, and card loss — `seal_local_rec()` runs on every exit path
including the module teardown, so nothing is left open when the WASM module
goes away. `bytes > 0` triggers a download: `downloadRecording()` reads the
file back with the disk-backed `getFile()` (no in-memory copy of a
multi-gigabyte flight) and drives a synthetic `<a download>` click. A
recording sealed at 0 bytes (stopped before the sync point, or the open
failed) is removed from OPFS rather than downloaded or listed.

**Recordings list** (Config tab, `Recordings.svelte`): every `.mp4` left in
OPFS, newest first, with Download/Delete per row and a running storage-used
line. Nothing is ever auto-deleted — a recording survives a page reload or a
crashed tab and reappears in the list next time the page opens (`Config →
Recordings` is how you get a file whose download the crash itself
interrupted). The first local recording of a session calls
`navigator.storage.persist()` (`App.svelte`) so the browser is less likely
to evict OPFS under storage pressure; `headroomWarning()` checks
`navigator.storage.estimate()` and shows a "Low browser storage: ~N MB free"
note under 1 GiB free, without blocking Record. `opfsOk` (the startup probe
result) gates the whole feature: with no usable OPFS the Recordings list
says so and local recording is off, VTX recording is unaffected.

**Stats and errors.** The 1 Hz stats line carries `lrec_avail` (0/1, the
startup probe result), `lrec_state` (0 off, 1 waiting-for-sync, 2 recording,
3 error), `lrec_bytes`, `lrec_err`, and `lrec_name`. `lrec_err` codes: 1 =
file open failed, 2 = write failed (storage full or gone), 3 = no OPFS in
this browser. The Debug tab's Client group has a `local rec` row (state ·
size · Mb/s, from `lrec_state`/`lrec_bytes` deltas) alongside the VTX
recorder's own row.

## Stats panel

A 1 Hz snapshot from the core (`webgs::Stats` / `stats_json()` in
`web/src/web_gs.cpp`), plus page-side timing JS adds on receipt, including
the recorder's `rec_state`/`rec_err` (Record, above) and `drone_temp_c`
(Telem `soc_temp_c`, null until a Telem lands or when the drone reports
−128 = no thermal source), shown as "Drone temp" on both the Stats tab and
the floating panel. In the windowed
layout this lives in the sidebar's Stats/Config/Debug tabs
(`Sidebar.svelte`); in immersive/fullscreen or on mobile it's a floating,
draggable panel (`FloatStats.svelte`, `web/ui/src/lib/layout.js`) instead,
so it stays visible over the fullscreen video. Every page-side segment row
shows p50/p99/max over both a 1 s and a 60 s window (USB lateness is the
core's own 1 s window). Page-side video metrics
(`web/ui/src/lib/metrics.js`'s `PageMetrics`, distinct from the core's 1 Hz
stats) resample every 200 ms over a trailing 1 s window: bitrate (AU bytes),
fps (draw count), and jitter (mean deviation from the nominal draw period);
latency there is capture→glass p50 in GS mode, and the rx→glass segment sum
in Spotter mode (no capture-side clock to measure capture→glass from
without the RTT estimator's offset — see Capture→glass below). "Copy
stats" copies `{core: [last 60 s of 1 Hz stats lines], segments: {w1, w60}}`
as JSON. Segments (spec §4):

| Segment | What it measures | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Control RTT (EWMA / min) | `RttEstimator`: RCF seq echoed back in `Telem`, clock-sync-free | GS |
| USB lateness p99/max | host arrival time − chip TSF, above the window's own minimum (`UsbLate`, `gs/src/usb_late.h`, read by `web_main.cpp`) | both |
| FEC/assembly | first body seen for the AU → AU complete, both timestamps on the core clock (`AuLatMeta`, `gs/src/frame_stream.cpp`) | both |
| Hand-off | AU complete (core/worker thread) → page receives it, both sides aligned to `performance.timeOrigin` | both |
| Decode | `VideoDecoder` chunk submit → decoded output callback | both |
| Present | decoded output → the first `requestAnimationFrame` after `drawImage` — an **estimate**, not `requestVideoFrameCallback`'s presentation time, because MSE/DRM-level present timestamps are not exposed to a WebCodecs canvas path; a callback that fires >1000 ms after its `drawImage` (a hidden tab suspends rAF, so the callback only runs once it's visible again — ~18 s outliers seen on the bench) is dropped rather than counted (`isStalePresentSample()`, `web/ui/src/lib/logic.mjs`) | both |
| Capture→glass (estimate) | drone `pts` + `RttEstimator`'s min-RTT-filtered `pts_off_us` → page present, same method as `maburplay`'s `lat.log`, but computed GS-side; shares Present's rAF path, so the same >1000 ms stale-sample drop applies (`isStalePresentSample()`) | GS only |

Capture→glass is GS-only because it needs the RTT estimator's pts-clock
offset, which only exists when this page is itself exchanging RCF/Telem
with the drone — a spotter has no control channel to measure it over, and
the panel says so rather than showing a stale or borrowed number.

Link state shown alongside: rung/MCS/width (a spotter shows its configured
width and the MCS read off the air -- the RX-descriptor MCS of CRC-clean
base-stream bodies, never enh or probe; since 2026-09-30 it no longer reads
the drone's applied-op echo, and it drives no ladder), probe gate state,
pre-FEC loss,
residual, SNR/RSSI, RCF heard % (Δ`Telem.rcf_rx` / Δ`rcf_sent` over a
trailing ~10 s window of the stats ring, not the adjacent 1 s tick —
`rcfHeardPctWindowed()` in `web/ui/src/lib/logic.mjs`; the two counters are
sampled at different instants, so diffing consecutive ticks read
100–105 % on the bench, and clamping would have hidden a real fault
instead of fixing the measurement. `rcf_sent` counts RCFs only, not the
DISC beacons/keep-alives that `sends` also counts, because the drone's
`rcf_rx` counts RCFs only; dividing by `sends` capped the ratio below the
95 % pass mark), AUs/s, and hitches (gaps
> 1.5× the frame period). No playout regulator and no vsync lock exist in
this build — the panel is measurement-only, by design (see the spec's
"Decided" list).

The core stats line also carries `osd_snaps` (MSP snapshots out of the FEC
sink) and `osd_screens` (OSD screens handed to the page); see MSP OSD below.

`trunc` counts truncated AUs of both layers; `trunc_base` is the sid-0
share of it (Debug tab Counters, `trunc base`) — the layer the NACK
protects, and the one whose loss smears until the next GDR/IDR.

`salvaged` (web stat `aus_salvaged`) counts AUs the core rebuilt by H.265
slice salvage (`docs/slices.md`): a truncated AU whose lost row slices
were filled with skip slices instead of being passed through truncated.
The JS Gate decodes a salvaged AU once armed, same as any other AU, but
never arms the decoder on one — only a complete AU is a sync point.

The Debug tab's **NACK** group (`debugGroups()` in `view.js`) reads the
stats line's `nack` block — `null` in spotter mode or with the switch off,
else the tracker's cumulatives (`req rep syms tail fill late waste drop sup
lead`, `sent` = T_NACK frames that left the card), `settle_ms`, the last
1 s window's fill latencies (`fill_p50/p90/max`, `fill_pps`; null while no
fill landed) and the drone's Telem counters summed once per `tlm_seq`
(`drone_rx`, `drone_syms`, `drone_refused`). See "Software NACK" below.

## MSP OSD

The flight controller's MSP DisplayPort OSD is drawn over the video in both
modes (it is receive-only, so Spotter's no-send guarantee is untouched, and
it does not wait for the GS session). The path is `maburgs`'s: `WebGs` feeds
stream-id 4 bodies to the same `maburgs::MspSink` (SBI unpack + sliding-
window FEC, `symbol_size`/`window` from the embedded config's `[msp]`, which
must match the drone; `[msp] enable = false` turns it off, `[msp.out]` is
ignored — there is no UDP here). `webgs::OsdScreen`
(`web/src/osd_screen.h`) runs each snapshot through the shared
`MspParser`/`MspScreen` and publishes a completed screen at most every 30 ms,
latest wins — `OsdSource`'s gate. The glue posts it as
`Module.onOsd(rows, cols, Uint16Array)`.

The page (`web/ui/src/lib/osd.js`) spreads the grid over the video box,
which is 16:9 in every layout — immersive (fullscreen, phones) letterboxes
the video instead of cropping it, so the OSD sits exactly on the picture and
an HD grid's (53x20) cells keep the font's 2:3 shape; an SD grid is widened
to 16:9 as on `maburplay`. It paints on a second canvas over the video, once per animation
frame at most, and blanks after 5 s without a screen (`maburplay`'s
`stale_ms` default) and on Disconnect. There is no toggle — trim elements in
the Betaflight OSD tab.

Font: Betaflight only, `web/ui/public/font_btfl.png` (32 glyphs per row,
36×54), generated from `maburplay`'s `gs/player/bundle/font_btfl.mfont` by
`tools/msp/gen_webfont.py` (re-run it if the `.mfont` changes; it
self-checks the round trip). The page fetches it on the first screen; a
failed fetch logs once to the console and leaves the OSD off for the rest of
that session (it is not refetched per screen), and the next Connect tries
once more. The 5 s blank counts from the last *published* screen, where
`maburplay` counts from the last datagram — the same thing in practice,
since Betaflight sends DRAW_SCREEN continuously.

## Software NACK

GS mode runs `docs/fec-nack.md`'s base-layer selective repeat with the same
`mabur::NackTracker` maburgs polls, over the same `SwDecoder` erasure view,
`FrameStream` tail view and ladder util (`WebGs::poll_nack_`, built only
in GS mode with `[link.nack] enable`; a spotter has no tracker, as it has
no `VrxController`). Per `tick()`, after the FrameStream poll: a new
`vtx_nonce` restarts the counter, no nonce or a dropped frame wire clears
the entries (the counter is kept, as the drone's `accept_nack_counter`
holds it under the same nonce), otherwise one `T_NACK` at most goes out
through `send_()` — direct, never the `RcfSlotter`, gated by the scout's
`may_send` like every control frame, counted in `sends` but not
`rcf_sent`. There is no calibration radio-silence gate (the page has no
calibration) and no `hdr_retx` latency-anchor rule (the page's
capture→glass uses the RTT pts offset, not a first-fragment anchor). The
`FragArrival` now carries `sw_seq`/`retx`, which is what makes the tail
trigger live. Option A as on maburgs: a retransmit-filled symbol still
counts as loss for the ladder. Over the CPE relay radio the request rides
the relay's TX round trip; on the bench that showed up as more repeats
(26 % of requests vs 11-15 % over USB) and a lower `drone_rx`/`sent`, not
as `lead_skipped` (0 in every arm). Readout: the Debug tab's NACK group (Stats panel, above); switch:
the Config tab (Config form, above). Pinned by `tests/test_web_gs.cpp`
(tagged counter-1 frame under unrepairable loss, counter across a
same-nonce rejoin vs a new nonce, the stats block, the overlay loader) and
`web/tests/{config,view}.test.mjs`.

**Bench (2026-10-07).** Native `webgs live --overlay` against the bench
drone (fec-nack maburd), pinned mcs2/40 on 144 (stop rule inert),
control (`[link.nack] enable = false`) vs NACK, 5 min per arm, counters
taken from 5 s in (see the join burst below). Interference: devourer
`txdemo` on one of the GS's 8822EU cards with maburgs stopped,
`benchjam.sh`'s frame shape (6M, 1000 B QoS-Data, foreign SA) at 333
frames/s — 180 was too gentle from that card (1 truncation/min), 500
starved the drone's TX (AUs/s fell to 30-50, frames lost whole, nothing a
NACK can fill). Order A1, B1, B2, A2 over USB, then RA, RB over the CPE
relay (`--relay 10.83.11.1:8310`):

| arm | AUs | trunc | trunc_base | req | syms | fill | waste | drop | drone_rx | drone_refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 control | 17512 | 149 | 79 | | | | | | | |
| B1 NACK | 17619 | 63 | 3 | 335 | 6596 | 4787 | 868 | 41 | 296 | 0 |
| B2 NACK | 17606 | 75 | 5 | 374 | 6977 | 4627 | 1057 | 155 | 313 | 0 |
| A2 control | 17550 | 115 | 54 | | | | | | | |
| RA relay control | 17521 | 140 | 57 | | | | | | | |
| RB relay NACK | 17589 | 89 | 6 | 529 | 10035 | 5170 | 1663 | 247 | 437 | 4 |

- **USB: pass.** Base truncations 133 → 8 (0.06×) at equal AUs;
  wasted 13-15 % of requested symbols; `drone_refused` 0; `suppressed` 0;
  `drone_rx`/`sent` 84-88 % (the jam hits the uplink too, repeats cover
  it). Fill latency only exists per 1 s window on this line: the
  fill-weighted median of the per-window p90 was 13-14 ms, the 90th
  percentile of it 25-28 ms, max 38/50 ms.
- **Relay: borderline.** 57 → 6 (0.105×, the 0.1 mark), wasted 17 %,
  `drone_refused` 4, repeats 26 %, `drone_rx`/`sent` 83 %.
- **Surviving base truncations** (~1/min with NACK) all fall in seconds
  with a 70-115-symbol request burst where the uplink NACK was lost
  (`drone_rx` < `sent`) or entries hit the deadline (`drop`). The page
  requests no IDR on a truncated AU (`Gate.onAu` → `skip: 'truncated'`),
  so each is a silent smear until the drone's GDR/IDR. Not acted on: a
  conditional IDR trigger stays the next bounded change if flights show it.
- **Join burst.** The first poll after link-up books the whole gap before
  the first heard symbol as missing (850-1000 syms, 400-430 `drop`, 4-18 requests),
  and the drone refuses most of it from its bucket (`drone_refused` ≈165
  in one shot). Harmless, but it inflates every cumulative counter read
  from link-up — take deltas.
- **Browser (headless Chrome, WebUSB, same pin + jam, 75 s):** linked,
  Debug NACK group moving (requests 18 → 101, filled 104 → 710, `drone rx`
  13 → 84), base truncations 3 in ~70 s. Most fill windows read 12-22 ms
  p50, but 3 of 14 read 62-114 ms — past the 50 ms gap timeout, where a
  fill is too late to save the AU. Native never showed that tail; it is
  the page's own scheduling (worker/WebUSB), unmeasured beyond this run.

## Colour correction

The drone flies the colortrans sensor file, which flattens the picture on
purpose; `maburplay` undoes it in the CRTC LUT (`docs/colortrans.md`). The
page does the same on the video, **on by default**, with an On/Off toggle
in the Config form's Display group. It is page-only (never sent to the
core, persisted in `webgs.cfg` as `colortrans`) and stays editable while
live — it takes effect on the next frame.

On: `VideoPipeline.draw()` (`web/ui/src/lib/video.js`) hands each decoded
`VideoFrame` to `ColorTransGl` (`web/ui/src/lib/colortrans.js`), which
uploads it with `texImage2D` and runs `frame_colortrans.cpp`'s shader over
one full-screen quad on a WebGL canvas. Off: the pre-existing 2D
`drawImage` on its own canvas — a canvas cannot change context type, so
the two are stacked in `App.svelte` and whichever drew the last frame is
the visible one; turning it off costs exactly what the page cost before.
The MSP OSD canvas sits above both, so no OSD pre-inversion is needed.
No WebGL, a shader that fails to build, or a lost context falls back to
flat for the rest of the page's life (one console line). The Stats
panel's Video line says which path is live: `· colortrans`,
`· colortrans unavailable` (wanted but fell back), or nothing (off).

Checked in headless Chromium (SwiftShader) against `ctForward`: 8 sample
pixels identical, frame the right way up. The constants are pinned by
`web/tests/colortrans.test.mjs` (see `docs/colortrans.md` for the retune
rule).

## Known limits

- **CPE relay radio from https needs Chrome 142+, a private-IP relay
  address, and a one-time "local network access" Allow.** See "CPE relay
  radio" above; Firefox needs the local page.
- **CPE relay: one owner at a time.** The relay itself enforces this, not
  the page — a `maburgs`/native `webgs` already running against the relay
  (or another tab) holds ownership, and this page reports `relay owned by
  another client` rather than fighting for it, in Spotter mode as well as
  GS mode. Same one-commander rule as
  two GS-mode pages against a USB-connected drone, below.
- **CPE relay: search only at boot.** The CPE has no FA/CCA/NHM reads, so
  on the relay the **boot** scout searches the set for the drone but never
  ranks members (`scan_state` reads `off`); auto on a relay means 'start
  member plus search'. This limit is boot-only: once linked, in-flight
  interference detection and hop run on a relay too, via `SCAN`/survey
  instead of energy reads (protocol v4, "Search-only scout on the relay"
  above). Each TUNE silently costs 50 ms of beaconing: the scout offers
  no DISC until the relay reports tuned (a CPE TUNE answers `retuning`
  after ~7 ms and `tuned` after 50 ms, flat over 30 retunes, measured
  2026-10-04), so a 100 ms search burst on a non-op member sends 2–3
  DISCs instead of 5. Measured against a USB card on the same search-only
  schedule (pinned, 4 ms FastRetune): 48.8 vs 56.0 DISCs per round at the
  same 0.7 rounds/s, 13 % fewer; nothing is dropped (`relay_tx_fail` and
  `relay_tx_refused` stay 0). Kept as built (spec §3.7's "wait for
  `ready()`" was not implemented): finding still works, and the wait
  would cost ~100 ms per round.
- **Spotter follows the link only by listening.** It needs ~0.15 s per
  member on a USB card (about 0.2 s per member on the CPE relay: a
  50 ms TUNE plus the dwell, so up to ~1.6 s for 8 members) to find the
  link at start (worst case the whole set) and up to
  2 s to give up on a followed order that never showed; it cannot ask the
  GS where the link is, and it does not verify the hop order it follows
  ("Spotter follower").
- **macOS: Chrome needs the system Local Network permission** (System
  Settings → Privacy & Security → Local Network) to reach any LAN address,
  the CPE's 10.83.11.1 included — on top of Chrome's own prompt.
- **Offline needs one online visit per channel** (stable and edge cache
  separately), and a new deploy is picked up on the next online reload.
- **RTL8812AU on a Linux host: unload `rtw88_8812au` first.** The kernel
  has an in-tree driver for the AU (the EU has none). devourer's
  `claim_interface_then_reset` resets the port after claiming, the kernel
  re-probes the interface, and `rtw88_8812au` takes it back mid-bring-up;
  Chrome cannot detach a kernel driver, so every transfer after init fails
  and the page reports `card lost` (an unbound card fails earlier, at
  `claimInterface`, once a re-enumeration has rebound it). Native `webgs`
  / `maburgs` don't see this — libusb detaches the kernel driver itself.
  Fix: `sudo modprobe -r rtw88_8812au` (holds until a replug or reboot; a
  reset keeps the device number, so nothing reloads it), or blacklist it
  (NixOS: `boot.blacklistedKernelModules = [ "rtw88_8812au" ];`). Bench
  2026-09-28: with the module unloaded, GS mode on an 8812AU (C-cut 2T2R,
  USB 3) connects, flies the ladder and plays video. The TP-Link
  RTL8821AU has the same problem with `rtw88_8821au`; unload that one.
- **Oilpan GC spikes.** Blink's incremental GC sweep of per-transfer WebUSB
  objects (`cppgc::Sweeper::IncrementalSweepTask`) runs on the thread that
  owns those objects and, after a major GC roughly every 8–13 s, costs one
  periodic spike of 8–14 ms — measured at both 38 and 54 Mb/s on air
  (native `maburgs`'s equivalent tail: ≤1.7 ms). Moving the runtime into a
  dedicated worker moves the sweep with it — the spike is unchanged. The
  only lever found is fewer USB transfers (chip-side RX aggregation), which
  is a latency trade, not taken here.
- **Spotter can never force an IDR.** No GS-relayed IDR request path exists
  (see "Spotter key frames" above and Follow-ups).
- **Spotter cannot gate on `CAP_FRAME_WIRE`.** Spotter mode has no
  rendezvous or caps exchange of its own — `web/src/web_gs.h`'s Spotter
  gate is always true, unlike GS mode, which only decodes while in
  SESSION with a peer that has advertised `CAP_FRAME_WIRE`. So a spotter
  cannot detect a caps-mismatched drone (a half-deployed `RC_VERSION`
  flag-day pair, `docs/deploy.md`): instead of refusing the stream the way
  a caps-aware GS would, it feeds the decoder whatever bitstream arrives,
  parseable or not.
- **Chrome must run via the Nix wrapper** (`bin/google-chrome-stable`), not
  the raw `share/google/chrome/chrome` binary — the raw binary has no
  libEGL, its GPU process dies, and WebCodecs then rejects the drone's HEVC
  stream outright ("Unsupported configuration").
- **Two GS-mode pages against one drone fight.** Nothing detects a second
  commander; both DISC and both send RCFs, and the ladder each one drives
  fights the other's. Spotter mode has no such conflict since it never
  transmits.
- **No OSD in the local recording.** `RawDvr` captures the raw HEVC
  bitstream ahead of the MSP OSD compositing, which only happens on the
  decoded/presented side — same limitation as `maburplay`'s raw DVR mode
  (`docs/observability.md`). Burning the OSD into the local file would need
  a decode+recompose+re-encode pass this page doesn't do.
- **A local recording may not play in Chrome's own `<video>` element**
  (pending the live browser bench, plan Task 9 Step 2 — this is expected,
  not yet confirmed): the file starts on the drone's GDR parameter-set
  refresh, not a real IRAP. Browsers commonly refuse to start playback on a
  file whose first frame isn't an IRAP, and Chrome's `<video>` element may
  do the same here (unconfirmed pending the bench). `mpv`/`ffmpeg` decode a
  GDR-first stream without issue.
- **Capture→glass can use a stale RTT offset for up to ~30 s after a drone
  restart.** `RttEstimator`'s pts-clock offset is never explicitly reset on
  a detected drone restart, in this page or in `maburgs` itself — the
  estimator re-converges from live samples over its own window rather than
  snapping to a fresh baseline, so the number briefly reflects the previous
  boot's clock relationship.
- **`drone_state` renders as a raw number**, not a decoded state name — the
  panel does not carry the enum-to-text mapping `maburtop.py` has.

## Design

The ladder's per-tick input is `LinkHealthAssembler`
(`gs/src/link_health.h`/`.cpp`), extracted verbatim out of `maburgs`'s
`main.cpp` control loop so both front ends compute the SAME windows
(`s1_loss`, `s3_loss`, residuals, probe tracking, RF-label staleness) the
same way — the point being that the web GS's ladder behaves exactly like
`maburgs`'s, not merely similarly. `maburgs` still owns log writing (ctl/
fec/probe logs, the sideport) and everything the assembler does not need to
decide the ladder itself: TX selector, cal radio silence (scan/hop/scout
and the hop verdict are the shared `ChannelCore`, below). `web/src/web_gs.h`'s `WebGs` composes the assembler with the
same `Aggregator`, `FrameStream`, `VrxController`, `RcfSlotter` and
`RttEstimator` maburgs uses, just with one card and no devourer types
reaching the core (`web/CMakeLists.txt`'s `webgs_core` links only the
receive + control subset of `mabur_common` — never `fec_worker` /
`sw_encoder` / `uep_encoder`, which call `pthread_setaffinity_np` and do not
build under Emscripten). The dot11 frame-building/parsing pure functions
(`build_control_frame`, foreign-SA drop, CRC-fail pass-through) live in
`gs/src/dot11.{h,cpp}`, shared with `RadioFrontend` the same way. In GS mode
`WebGs` also runs `maburgs::ChannelCore` (`gs/src/channel_core.h`) over the
card roster: the send gate, link-where-found, the boot scout, the
relocation and the one-card hop, the same object `maburgs` drives.
`web/src/web_main.cpp` is the glue: it builds a card roster of `maburgs`'s
own card classes — a `maburgs::RadioFrontend` (`gs/src/radio_frontend.{h,cpp}`;
libusb with the WebUSB backend under Emscripten, native libusb1 on the
host; its RX thread feeds a `BodyQueue`) or a `maburgs::RemoteCard` for the
CPE relay — and the core loop driving `WebGs` over it; it builds as a
native CLI (`webgs live`/`webgs replay`, used for bench A/B against the
browser and for the parity gates) and, under `emcmake`, as the page's WASM
module.

FastRetune between HT40 members over WebUSB: median 3.75 ms, p95 ≈ 4.1 ms,
worst seen ≈ 12.6 ms (native 3.75 / 3.76 / 11.5); width change 40→20 ≈
55 ms, 20→40 ≈ 71 ms; a full scout dwell ≈ 300 ms (spike 2026-10-04,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-web-gs-channel-core-design.md` §8).

**CPE relay radio.** `maburgs::RemoteCard` (`gs/src/remote_card.{h,cpp}`) is
the radio-source alternative to the WebUSB path — the same card class
`maburgs` runs for `radio.relays`: it wraps `RelayClient` (the shared,
protocol-agnostic `gs/src` core) with a `RelayTransport` and its own RX
thread, feeding the same `BodyQueue` the USB path drains — `WebGs` doesn't
know which radio fed it. The page sets `Cfg::restart_when_refused` false
(one relay, one client: a refusal is reported, not retried) and both modes
wait for ownership. Native builds get `RelayTransport` over UDP directly; under
Emscripten it's `web/src/relay_ring.h`'s SPSC byte ring instead, because a
WASM pthread can't own a browser WebSocket — the actual socket lives in the
page's dedicated `relay_worker.js` Worker, and the ring (with its JS twin
`web/ui/src/lib/relay_ring.js`, kept byte-identical, pinned by shared golden
vectors in both languages' test suites) is the SharedArrayBuffer bridge
between that Worker and the WASM core's RX thread. The core queues HELLO
and TUNE into the TX ring immediately on start, before the Worker's
`WebSocket` has necessarily finished opening, so `relay_worker.js`
(`workerStep()`) never spins synchronously waiting for `onopen` — it parks
on `Atomics.waitAsync` against the ring's state word instead, and pumps the
queued TX once the socket actually opens. The same loop honours a core
`STOP_REQ` written into that state word even while still connecting, so a
Disconnect during the ~500 ms-2.5 s HELLO/TUNE dance closes the socket
right away rather than waiting for it to open first.

## Validation

Bench, 2026-09-27, bench drone on ch136 HT40, drone `low_power` off:

- **maburgs regression** (this page's changes don't regress the native
  daemon — same `LinkHealthAssembler`): two A/B pairs (master vs. this
  branch's `maburgs`, second pair run in reversed order), each leg fed two
  15 s `benchjam` episodes (power 63, 2000 pps, 1500 B, 6M) from a host
  8822EU. Identical demote reasons, ~1 s cascade to rung 0, probed
  re-climb 0→5 in 7–9 s in every leg; rung-5 `s3_residual` bounce rate 1.21
  vs. 1.13/min in the reversed pair (the *first* pair's 2.6 vs. 1.7/min
  tracked the time slot, not the binary — not attributable to this
  branch). `ausniff` 30 s clean in every leg (~1815 AUs, 60.5 fps, ≤3
  incomplete enh).
- **Web GS mode, GS daemon stopped**: linked (DISC→ACK→SESSION), climbed
  to the bundle ladder's top (rung 4, mcs4/40). Hand-covering the host
  card's antenna (RSSI −83..−86 dBm, SNR 9–13 dB) demoted to rung 1–2 and
  it recovered via clean probes in ~15–20 s; after a 30 s total outage it
  re-linked by itself. txfail 0. capture→glass p50 ~24 ms, p99 ~45 ms;
  link RTT ~9 ms (min 3–4 ms); FEC/assembly p50 ~6.6 ms; decode ~0.8 ms;
  hand-off 0.1 ms.
- **Spotter mode next to a running `maburgs`**: browser `sends` 0 /
  `rcf_sent` 0 / `txfail` 0 (Spotter never transmits, confirmed on the
  wire, not just by code inspection) — drone RCF rx rate 18.7/s over 30 s
  matched `maburgs`'s own sideport `drone.rcf.rx_pps` 18.5 (a transmitting
  browser would roughly double it). Video started after an 11 s wait for
  a natural IDR (see "Spotter key frames" above), then ran at 61 AUs/s.
- **Seen but not fixed**: 2 WebCodecs `EncodingError` decoder resets in
  ~10 min (each recovered on the next IRAP — the existing `gate.armed =
  false` / re-arm path, `onDecoderError()`). Left as a follow-up; no
  drone/wire signature was found in the ~10 min sample to attribute it to.

**Redesigned page, bench 2026-09-27** (Chrome 147 driven over DevTools,
bench drone on ch136 HT40, GS box off for GS mode):

- **Connect → Disconnect → Connect ×10** (GS mode, drone on): 10/10, no
  reload fallback; Disconnect ~200 ms (`teardown: rx 10–20 ms, chip stop
  45–100 ms` — the stdout teardown line of that build; it is now stderr
  `maburgs radio card 0: teardown rx <ms> [(reads aborted)]`, see
  Connect/Disconnect under Use), relink ~6.2 s (dominated by the card's ~5 s init), video
  back at once (link-up IDR).
- **Disconnect with the drone powered off**: before the interface-release
  abort (above) the core never exited and the 3 s reload fallback fired
  every time (recovery itself worked: page back on Config, next Connect
  claimed the card, "No drone on ch 136 / 40 MHz (still trying)" after
  10 s). With the abort: 3/3 in-page, click → Disconnected 584 ms
  (`rx 305 ms (reads aborted), chip stop 79 ms`), next Connect claims the
  card; drone-on cycles unchanged afterwards (5/5, 150–200 ms).
- **Config form**: Max MCS 3 → 4 rungs, link tops out at MCS 3; Fixed
  MCS 2 → `Pinned`, steady MCS 2 at 40 MHz.
- **VTX record** round trip: Record reached the drone and its `Telem`
  answer came back — this drone has no SD card, so the page showed
  `REC!` with "No SD card" (windowed button title and immersive tag). A
  recording that actually runs was not exercised.
- **Latency** (60 s steady, rung 4 mcs4/40): capture→glass p50 23 ms /
  p99 34 ms, FEC p99 11–13 ms, decode p99 1.0 ms, hand-off 0.1–0.2 ms,
  60 fps, jitter 2.6 ms — within noise of (or better than) the numbers
  above.
- **Layouts**: windowed, F → fullscreen immersive, config side panel,
  844×390 phone emulation (236 px float panel; its fullscreen button
  toggles the real Fullscreen API — see below),
  390×844 portrait notice; float-panel drag follows the pointer and clamps
  to x = 844 − 236 − 8, y = 390 − 48; video kept playing across every
  layout switch (one canvas).
- **Spotter next to `maburgs`**: `sends 0 / rcf_sent 0 / txfail 0`,
  60 AUs/s, Record disabled with its reason, Disconnect 200 ms.
- Seen, not attributed to this page: 4 TX `bulk_send` timeouts (rc −7) in
  ~5 min of GS mode, each followed by one decoder reset; one drone boot
  came up with a deaf radio (no RX on the host card natively either) until
  the drone was power-cycled.

On a phone the layout is always the immersive one, but the browser's own
bars stay until the page asks for real fullscreen: the fifth round button
(corners-out / corners-in) calls `requestFullscreen()` and then tries
`screen.orientation.lock('landscape')` (Android Chrome allows the lock only
while fullscreen), and follows the actual `fullscreenchange` state. It is
hidden where the Fullscreen API isn't available (`document.fullscreenEnabled`
false — iPhone Safari).

Not yet exercised: a real phone over LAN TLS (layouts were checked in
Chrome's device emulation only), and the spotter mirroring a
`maburgs`-started recording (the GS's record wish was reset to off right
after `vtx_rec on` on the bench).

### Local recording, 2026-09-28

Host gates only — the live browser bench (this feature's own plan, Task 9
Step 2: record-and-play round trips, the mid-recording tab-kill/reopen
case, disconnect/card-loss downloads, `Both`-target start/stop, Recordings
list delete) is pending; the controller will add its results here after
the human runs it on the bench card and drone.

- **Host suite**: `ctest --test-dir build -R 'test_|host_e2e'` 162/162
  passed; `ctest --test-dir build -R 'gs_e2e|gs_au_e2e|player_e2e'` 3/3
  passed.
- **WASM/native parity** (`web/tests/test_wasm_parity.sh`, native `webgs`
  vs. `webgs_node`, includes the `--record` mp4 path added for this
  feature): 5/5 fixtures passed — byte-identical AUs, control traces and,
  where a run reaches a sync point, byte-identical mp4s. The standing
  fixture and the 25 %-drop long run correctly record nothing on both
  sides (no complete parameter-set AU reaches `RawDvr` in either case, by
  construction of those fixtures — see the script's own comments); the
  clean and 10 %-drop long runs each recorded a matching ~1.4–2.0 MB mp4
  on both sides.

### Channel set, relocation, one-card hop — bench 2026-10-04 (plan 2)

Branch `web-gs-core` (the card stack + `ChannelCore` in GS mode). Bench
drone on the desk, host RTL8812EU (0bda:a81a) as the page's card, headless
Chrome 147 driven over CDP against `python3 web/serve.py 8808`, the real
link key loaded into the page (`webgs.key`). `maburgs` on the GS was
stopped for the page runs (one commander). The GS itself first ran the
branch's `maburgs` (the `ChannelCore` papercuts of this plan) as the
standing regression gate.

| row | result |
|---|---|
| maburgs regression (branch `maburgs` on the GS, drone remembering 144) | PASS — `set [40,64,112,144] mode auto start 144 (remembered)`, `pick frozen on 144 (commit) after 3 rounds`; ausniff 60 s: 1815 AUs, 0 frame_id gaps, 0 incomplete, 30.3 fps |
| web GS, USB, auto, start 40, drone parked on 112 (A: page still on the default key) | drone found on 112 but **Key mismatch** (the drone rejects the default key, as designed); the pick froze on 40 at `max_ms` after 6 rounds; the header walked the scout dwells (`CH 112 · 40 MHz · scanning`, …); Disconnect: `teardown rx 304 ms (reads aborted)`, `DONE` |
| same, B: real key loaded | **PASS** — card up 6.8 s after Connect; `one-card prelude ranking picks 64 (op 40)` +10.2 s, `CHANNEL 64`, `commit card -1 40 -> 64`; `drone found on 112 (op 64): the link forms there` +14.2 s, `CHANNEL 112`, `link_found`, `pick frozen on 64 (one-card linked) after 2 rounds`, `relocate 112 -> 64 placed`, `one_card_retune` +238 ms, `lead_confirm` +253 ms, `hop_follow`, `CHANNEL 64`, `verify_pass` +1002 ms; header `Linked · CH 64 · 40 MHz · hop` then `CH 64 · 40 MHz`; drone log `retune 112 -> 64 (hop)`, drone `/etc/mabur.channel` 64; `localStorage.webgs.channel` 64 at the end. The same K/M/H order as `maburgs` row 5 (`docs/channel-select.md`) |

Note: two consecutive auto sessions picked 64 then 112 and moved the drone each time — the co-located bench's ranker noise (`docs/channel-select.md` rows 6/7), not a page defect |
| reactive hop against the bench jammer (page pinned on 144, drone on 144; jam = devourer `txdemo` cross-built for arm64 and run on the GS box's spare card 2-1.4 because the host's only Realtek card is the page's radio: QoS-Data 1000 B at 6M, 4 ms interval, SA `02:4a:41:4d:00:01`, `DEVOURER_TX_PKT_OFSET=0`, 40 s) | **PASS** — link at +6.7 s after Connect; jam from +60 s; at +68.5 s `hold_exhausted`/`hold_end` (epoch 0) then `order epoch 1 target 64`, `one_card_retune` +243 ms, `hop_one_card 144 -> 64`, `lead_confirm` +262 ms, `hop_follow`, `CHANNEL 64`, `verify_pass` +1003 ms; header `Linked · CH 64 · 40 MHz`; the Radio group's residual read 11.7 % at the order and 0.00 % again within ~5 s, and stayed 0.00 % for the remaining 80 s with the jam still running on 144; drone log `retune 144 -> 64 (hop)`, drone `/etc/mabur.channel` 64. One-card hop timings match `maburgs`'s 2026-10-04 one-card row (+216/+235 ms). The `txdemo` arm64 build only resolves its include dirs when the cross `g++` wrapper runs inside a `nix-shell`; bare it silently fails to find `libusb.h` (environmental, not reproduced to a cause) |
| relay GS, search-only scout (CPE at 10.83.11.1 over the host USB NIC, set `{40, 64, 112}` — no 144 — auto, start 40; drone moved onto 112 ~40 s after Connect) | **PASS** — `maburgs relay card 0 (10.83.11.1:8311): owned and tuned` at once; `scan off` throughout (the relay search-only path, spec §3.7) with the header walking the search bursts (`CH 40`/`CH 64`/…) and `scan_rounds` climbing ~0.7/s; `drone found on 112 (op 40): the link forms there` +59 s, `CHANNEL 112`, `link_found card -1 40 -> 112`; `Linked · CH 112 · 40 MHz`, pre-FEC 0.0 %, residual 0.00 %, linked for the remaining 120 s. Seen: the relay card's state line flaps `waiting for STATUS` ↔ `owned and tuned` on every search-burst TUNE (`RemoteCard::log_transition` logs each flip; noise, not a fault) |
| relay spotter | NOT RUN — the spotter follower is plan 3; a relay spotter in this build only sits on its start member. Host-side coverage of the relay path: `web_relay_e2e` (12 cases: owned/refused/tune-failed/lost/taken early and late, spotter refused when not owner, `scan_state` `off`, 20 MHz sets) |

Seen but not fixed: `RadioFrontend::stop()` prints a second
`teardown rx 0 ms` line when the destructor runs after an explicit `stop()`
(cosmetic). The page's AU/gap counters were not captured by the driver in
these runs (the Debug tab was read before it re-rendered); the `Linked`
tag, the drone's `retune` line and the `verify_pass` (which needs video on
the target) stand in for them.

### Spotter follower — bench 2026-10-04 (plan 3)

Branch `spotter-follow` (fffd1db) page, served from `web/dist` and driven
headless (Chrome 147 over CDP, the WebUSB-granted profile; the driver
clicks Spotter + the radio, writes the channel set into `webgs.cfg`, and
reads the 1 Hz STATS through a `JSON.parse` hook plus the Debug tab's
Channel row every second). The GS ran plan 2's `maburgs` a155bf32 — **not
redeployed by this plan** (its only GS-side changes are a log-transition
rule and an Emscripten-only guard) — under a temporary bench config: one
card (`[[radio.cards]] index = 0`, which came up on usb 2-1.4, leaving
2-1.1 for the jammer) and `channels = [40, 64, 112]` (no 144: the page
still carried its stale "CPE cannot tune 144" refusal, removed the same
night), remembered 64; the drone's `/etc/mabur.channel`
was set to 64 for the bench. Both configs were restored afterwards (GS
`[40,64,112,144]` two-card auto, drone 144). Jam = plan 2's recipe
(`txdemo` on the GS's free card: QoS-Data 1000 B at 6M, 4 ms interval,
non-canonical SA, `DEVOURER_TX_PKT_OFSET=0`, 40 s). STATS are 1 Hz, so
every "within a second" below is that resolution.

| row | result |
|---|---|
| A — USB spotter opened mid-flight (link on 64, spotter set `[40,64,112]`, remembered channel cleared, so it starts on 40) | **PASS** — `webgs live: mode spotter ch 40` at +1.0 s after Connect; card up +5.3 s later (the usual ~5 s init); the first STATS, one second after that, already read `locked` on 64 (`follows 0`): the 150 ms dwell on 40, one FastRetune and the lock on the first frame all fit inside the first STATS interval. Header `CH 40 · 40 MHz` from module start (the start member, not the form's `auto`), then `CH 64 · 40 MHz`; 30 AUs/s, 0 truncated, `sends 0`, one `teardown rx 50 ms` line at Disconnect |
| B — USB spotter follows `maburgs` hops (jam on 64 from +55 s for 40 s) | **PASS** — `maburgs`: `hold_exhausted` → `order epoch 1 target 112` → `one_card_retune` +253 ms → `lead_confirm` +294 ms, then the jam leaking onto every member at bench distance (as in plan 2 and `docs/channel-select.md` row 6) chained `verify_fail epoch 2 → 40` and `escape epoch 3 → 64` within ~3 s, a 27 s hold, `order epoch 4 → 112`, a `hold_cap` run, and `order epoch 5 → 40`. Spotter STATS: `locked 64 follows 0` → `locked 112 follows 1` → `locked 40 follows 2` → `locked 64 follows 3` in three consecutive seconds (+55.8/+57.1/+58.4 s), `locked 112 follows 4` at +86.5 s, `locked 40 follows 5` at +118.5 s — six orders, six follows, every one re-locked on the target inside the next STATS; no STATS sample ever read `following` or `sweeping`. AU rate 26–31/s throughout; truncated AUs 0 → 49 during the jam window (jam loss and the hops), flat at 49 afterwards; `sends 0`. Drone `/etc/mabur.channel` followed (40 at the end) |
| C — CPE relay spotter follows via TUNE (CPE 10.83.11.1, link on 40, jam on 40 from +55 s) | **PASS** — `maburgs relay card 0 (10.83.11.1:8311): connecting` / `waiting for STATUS` / `owned and tuned` once at start and **never again** (the plan-2 flap on every TUNE is gone; `relay_state` read 0 in all 149 STATS samples); `locked 40` on the first STATS; `maburgs` ordered `epoch 6 → 64` (`verify_pass`) 3 s into the run on its own, then under the jam `epoch 7 → 40`, `verify_fail epoch 8 → 112`, `epoch 9 → 64`, `escape epoch 10 → 112`, `epoch 11 → 40`; the spotter's `follows` went 1…6 in step (+4 s, +55 s, +56 s, +86 s, +87 s, +117 s), each sample `locked` on the new member (the TUNE's 50 ms plus the lock fit inside one STATS interval). 30 AUs/s, 5 truncated in total, `sends 0`, relay TX 0 |
| D — withdrawn hop / timeout return | **not provoked** — no `withdraw` line appeared in `maburgs`'s log across rows B–E (18 orders/escapes/verify_fails, every one confirmed); the bench has no fault injector for a drone that fails to follow. Covered host-side by `tests/test_spotter_follow.cpp` (`timeout_and_return`, `withdrawal_heard_on_back_returns_at_once`, `standing_order_after_timeout_return_is_ignored`) and `tests/test_web_gs.cpp` `spotter_follow_timeout_returns_the_card` |
| E — Disconnect / Connect in spotter mode (USB) | **PASS** — Disconnect at +30 s: exactly one `teardown rx 60 ms` line (the plan-2 double line is gone), `DONE` 1.0 s after the click, header `Disconnected · CH auto`; Connect again 5 s later: `webgs live` +1.0 s, card up +4.3 s, `locked 64` on the first STATS; second Disconnect: one `teardown rx 80 ms`, `DONE`. In the first session the spotter also followed an unprovoked `maburgs` hop 40 → 64 at +25 s (`follows 1`) |

Seen, not a page defect: `maburgs` hopped twice without a jammer (row C
+3 s, row E +25 s) and chained `verify_fail` hops under the jam — the
one-card verdict on the co-located bench, `docs/inflight-channel-hop.md`,
not the spotter. With the drone off, a spotter reads `locked` on
whichever member the GS is beaconing on (the DISC search bursts are mabur
traffic; see "Spotter follower"). The `localStorage` `webgs.channel` is
never written in spotter mode (no `CHANNEL` line without a `ChannelCore`),
so a spotter always starts on the pin or the first member and sweeps —
one dwell per member, which row A shows costs well under a second.

## Follow-ups

Not built here, all noted in the spec as later work:

- A GS-relayed IDR request for Spotter mode (GS mode has its own periodic
  request since spec 2026-09-28, "Key-frame recovery" above), so a spotter
  opened mid-flight does not wait indefinitely for the drone's next
  unsolicited IDR.
- Foreign-GS detection, so a second GS-mode page against the same drone
  gets a warning instead of silently fighting the first one's ladder.
- Auto-reconnect after the card is unplugged and replugged, instead of
  requiring a manual Connect.
