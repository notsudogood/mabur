//    freeze-crash (docs/shed-lag-findings-2026-08-09.md).
//  - force=false, non-decrease (steady-state LINKED RCFs): the call is
//    throttled to at most once per 1000ms, so repeated RCFs within one
//    second collapse to a single call (scenario: bitrate hysteresis) and a

//    filtered an ABSOLUTE target with no accumulator, so an error smaller
//    than the band could never grow into it and the last applied value
//    became a fixed point. Prod (airtime_budget 0.60, bitrate_max_kbps
//    10000) hit it at the top of the ladder: rung4 commands 9400, rung5's
//    12480 clamps to 10000, and |10000-9400| = 600 < 940 meant the promote
//    was discarded forever — the link ran mcs5 while the encoder stayed on
//    the mcs4 bitrate, 6% low, on the rung the link occupies almost all
//    the time. Note it takes the CLAMP to create the trap: unclamped, the
//    rung gap is far wider than 10%. Decreases were always exempt, so the
//    error only ever accumulated downward.
//  - force=true (BOOT's initial MAX_RANGE apply, every LINKED->FAILSAFE
//    entry, and RCFs that transition into LINKED from RENDEZVOUS/FAILSAFE):
//    the throttle and dedup gates are bypassed entirely — the new
//    operating point's bitrate (e.g. the MCS0 floor on failsafe entry)
//    takes effect immediately, every time. The value is still clamped and
//    rounded to 100 as usual. The throttle timestamp is updated afterwards
//    either way, so a steady-state RCF arriving shortly after a forced call
//    is throttled normally.
//
// The target is a PURE FUNCTION OF THE OPERATING POINT — rung PHY rates
// and the commanded overhead pair in, kbps out. Nothing measured enters
// it, so a fixed op commands a fixed bitrate for as long as it is held.
//
// It was measurement-anchored between 2026-08-29 and 2026-09-01: AirFeed
// published a live share_base plus per-stream framing excess (emitted air
// bytes over frame bytes, EWMA), and this function blended them in. That
// correction was real — framing excess runs ~5% at large frames and more
// as frames shrink — but it closed a loop the encoder could not afford.
// Lower rate -> smaller frames -> proportionally more padding -> higher
// excess -> lower target, re-evaluated on every RCF at 10-20 Hz, with the
// 100 kbps rounding grid fine enough that the dither kept crossing it.
//
// On Star6E every MI_VENC_SetChnAttr that actually changes the rate emits
// a keyframe (measured 2026-09-01: 15 real changes, 15 IDRs, each on the
// next frame; 16 same-value writes, 0 IDRs), and that keyframe bypasses
// idr_rate_limit entirely. In flight-0000 an IDR cost a median 63.8 kB
// against a 21.4 kB base P frame — 38 ms of airtime at the rung it flew,
// p95 92 ms — and 151 of 226 bitrate writes had no rung change behind
// them. The blend was buying a few percent of airtime accuracy with ~150
// keyframes per 12-minute flight.
//
// So the measurement is gone and the share is a constant. kShareBase is
// the measured median: 561 one-second windows of flight-0000 gave p50
// 0.601, sd 0.044, and fixing it there costs -2.7%/+1.0% of target on the
// worst overhead pair in that flight (1.0/0.5). On an EQUAL pair the term

  // or an RCF the agent loop drained at the same millisecond) must not
  // immediately run it again — most visibly when that run FAILED, where the
