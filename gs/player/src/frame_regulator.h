// Phase-aware display release (display.regulate_ms). Decoded frames are
// held until floor(pts) + D on the GS monotonic clock, so presentation
// follows the encoder's capture cadence instead of arrival jitter — the
// dejitter spike measured today's mailbox presenter at ~750–940 vsync
// repeat+skip pairs/min and a D of 12–16 ms removing ~70% of them for
// under 5 ms of added mean latency (docs/dejitter-findings-2026-08-30.md).
//
// Clock map: pts is the drone's 32-bit µs counter; it is unwrapped by
// deltas and anchored by the FASTEST observed frame (min of mono − pts),
// so D means "delay past the best-case delivery path" — exactly how the
// spike measured the completion-delay distribution. The floor snaps down
// instantly when a faster frame proves it and leaks upward at kLeakPpm to
// follow relative clock drift (measured ~20 ppm; the leak is 3× that).
//
// Ownership: offer() either passes the frame through (present it NOW —
// regulator disabled, frame already past its release, or a pts
// discontinuity re-seed) or holds it in a kMaxHeld-deep queue. A held
// frame displaced by a newer one, or orphaned by a discontinuity, comes
// back via *out (up to kMaxHeld at once) and MUST be returned to the
// backend by the caller. release_due() surfaces held frames once their
// time arrives — call it in a loop, since more than one can be due in
// the same tick.
//
// Queue depth (bench A/B 2026-08-30, generalized 2026-09-02): the old
// single-slot mailbox meant that once D approached the spacing to the
// next burst-decoded frame, displacement rate climbed and the dropped
// frames judder more than the smoothing helps — 12 ms measured 2.94 ms
// present-jitter with 5 replacements, 16 ms measured 5.32 ms with 804.
// Multiple slots let the queue hold one frame per vsync target instead
// of collapsing every arrival onto a single held frame; in fallback mode
// (no vsync lock) all entries share target_v == 0, so the same-target
// displacement rule below reproduces the old single-slot mailbox
// exactly. Depth 4 (was 2) covers the post-stall backlog: the decode
// sink offers before the main loop drains overdue releases, so a stall
// spanning a release deadline plus a decode burst legitimately wants 3+
// distinct vsync targets in hold — at 120 Hz (8.3 ms periods) with
// D=12–16 that window doubles relative to the 60 Hz bench. A full queue
// still evicts the oldest (most-overdue) head: latency-first.
