constexpr double kHopSettleBlankMs = 150.0;

// Pure: how far ahead the ladder's rung store should be blanked, given the
// verdict window that just closed (spec section 4: the store's residual/
// util EWMAs are not updated "from the first impaired window until hop
// confirmation plus the existing 150 ms post-transition settle-blank").
//
// Extracted like hop_burst_gate.h so the one decision has a unit test
// instead of only ever running inside run_radio()'s hardware-touching
// verdict block. The call site (gs/src/main.cpp, right after
// HopVerdict::window()) feeds the result to VrxController::blank_store(),
// which keeps the LATER of the deadlines it is given -- so this composes
// with, and never shortens, the deadline HopAction::Order sets.
//
// Three gates, each load-bearing:
//
//  - `reactive`: the reactive layer is armed (auto mode; ChannelCore passes
//    !pinned). Pinned, nothing is ever ordered and the rung is never
//    restored, so there is no hop for the store to be protected from --
//    blanking anyway would silently change what a pinned flight records.
//    HopAction::Order's own blank_store() call never fires there (the
//    controller is never fed a trigger), so this keeps the two consistent.
//
//  - VerdictOut::first_interfered, NOT ref_frozen. ref_frozen is keyed on
//    `impaired`, and Fade (impaired AND weak) and Unknown (impaired
//    otherwise) are impaired too -- so keying on it blanked the store
//    through every fade and every unknown window, while section 4's last
//    bullet is "fade/unknown: unchanged ladder behaviour". Only
//    interference hops, so only interference blanks.
//
//  - One edge per frozen episode, which is what BOUNDS the blank. The
//    deadline is computed once, at the episode's first interfered window,
//    and spans exactly confirm_ms + the settle -- the same span the
//    Order-time call uses, so detection and the hop itself are scoped
//    alike. It is not re-extended by later interfered windows, so a jam
//    that runs for seconds (or alternates interfered and healthy windows
//    inside one frozen episode) cannot roll it forward indefinitely; the
//    store resumes writing confirm_ms + 150 ms after onset whether or not
//    a hop was ever ordered. Re-arming needs a genuine thaw: 3 consecutive
//    healthy windows, or HopVerdict::reset() after a verify window ends.
//
// Starting at the first interfered window rather than at the order is the
// point: the order is 2-3 persistence windows (300-450 ms) later, so every
// detection window -- including the demotes section 4 explicitly expects,
// "a demote or two, each an IDR" -- was being written into the per-rung
// store against the interfered channel.

// instant the link lands on the new channel -- plus the same settle as the
// store blank, so the verify that follows is judged on loss measured on the
// channel it is verifying. Unblanked, the first eligible verify window still
// carried the jam on the old channel and the hop's own retune gap: 128 read
// 50.9 % loss with zero foreign frames and failed (bench 2026-09-24, GS
// session 0207), which sent the retry back into the jam. The verdict gets
// its own window rather than blanking s1_loss, which also feeds the
// sideport/ctl-log/OSD loss gauge the pilot reads. Every other action keeps
// the link where it was (Order/OneCardRetune: the confirm has not happened;
// Withdraw: the trailing card never left op), so it blanks nothing.
