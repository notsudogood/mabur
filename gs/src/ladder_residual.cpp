// The BASE layer's post-FEC loss, from the FEC decoder's own abandonment
// count -- symbols that fell below the sliding-window horizon still unknown
// (SwDecoder::advance). Current-rung only: syms_abandoned_stale is the
// pre-transition debris the attribution watermark already accounted for.
//
// NOT the packet-level delivery window (window_counts_cur), which this
// replaced on 2026-09-02. That measure inferred loss from FRAG-seq gaps, and
// a gap is indistinguishable from a unit that merely has not completed yet:
// a sliding-window repair landing late completes an older unit after a newer
// one, and the next forward gap re-books the already-delivered unit as a
// fresh expectation. In a window holding 3-6 units that reads as 0.25 or
// 0.33 residual, and block 4 demotes on anything > 0 -- 31 spurious demotes
// in ~7 min on the bench with abn=0 the whole time. Symbol abandonment is
// pure seq arithmetic over a span and cannot be fooled by arrival order.
//
// The trade is detection lag: a lost symbol is booked only once the horizon
// passes it (seq_horizon 512 at ~6.4k sym/s is ~80 ms), where the packet
// measure fired on the next forward gap. The ENH layer's demote path has
// always accepted exactly this (see s3_resid_cur in gs/src/main.cpp).
//
// BASE only, deliberately: the packet measure pooled sid 0 and sid 1, a
// leftover from the 4-stream era when sid 0/1/2 were all base layers (see
// the "never-shed base layers" note on window_counts). Since the 2-stream
// flatten sid 1 is the SHED-ABLE enh layer, which has its own demote path
// in block 5a; pooling it here let enh loss demote through both.
//
// abandoned also folds in syms_retx: a symbol a NACK retransmit filled
// (or cascade-solved off a repair row) is video-whole but its direct copy
// never arrived -- option A, spec 2026-10-05: the ladder sees the loss,
// only the video does not. syms_retx has no stale split: a retx filling a
// pre-transition seq counts as current residual loss even under `cur`
// (negligible -- the drone only answers seqs within ring_ms, and a
// transition gap is a handful of symbols).
