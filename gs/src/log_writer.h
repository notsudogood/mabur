// One writer thread for every debug-log file in a session directory.
//
// Producers format a line and hand it over with line(); the writer thread
// does every fopen/fwrite/fflush. This exists because au.log is ~120 rows/s
// and probe.log ~60 rows/s, both emitted from the RX core thread, onto
// /media/dvr -- a real disk. A blocking write there is a video-latency
// hazard (the burn-DVR write-combining spike is the precedent).
//
// SINGLE PRODUCER. Every maburgs debug log is fed from the core loop thread;
// the head/tail pair is only safe under that invariant. flush_now() may be
// called from the producer thread only.
//
// Failure is always non-fatal: open() returns kBadStream on an unusable
// directory, line() on kBadStream is a no-op, and a full ring drops the line
// and counts it. The writer thread emits "# dropped N" into the affected
// file when it next flushes, so a gap is always visible in the data.
