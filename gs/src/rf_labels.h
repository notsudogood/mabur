// a deep fade does. A frozen EMA must never reach the trigger as if it were a
// live measurement, and it must not win this argmax either: a wedged
// front-end whose pooled EMA froze high would otherwise outrank a live
// sibling card forever, blanking the labels on a multi-card GS for as long as
// it stayed wedged.
