// Rung-transition edge-detect for loss attribution, extracted from the
// control step in gs/src/main.cpp (2026-09-05) so the wiring is testable:
// the dry-run e2e never runs the ladder, so before this nothing on the
// host could pin which decision windows get settle-blanked at an edge.
//
// On a COMMANDED op change (mcs, bw or base overhead) this (1) marks the decoder's per-sid transition
// watermark, (2) settle-blanks the two residual decision windows and (3)
// clears the two util decision windows (back since 2026-10-06, flight
// 0026; see on_tick). The util windows stopped being blanked on 2026-09-05
// when they moved to the ArrivalTracker -- the base (s1) residual window since 2026-09-02 (flight
// ctl-0160: one residual event walked the ladder to rung 0 at 50 ms/rung),
// and the enh (s3) residual window since 2026-09-05 (flights 20/21: 13 of
// 14 s3_residual cascades took a second step at exactly s3_settle_ms and
// were promoted straight back). The controller's s3_blank_until only gates
// READING for s3_settle_ms; the 500 ms window behind it kept the
// abandonment-horizon's ~80 ms late booking of old-rung loss, so the tick
// the gate opened it demoted again on a 0 ms confirm. Bench ctl-0287's
// s3_util re-fire was NOT completion-counter debris the tracker fails to
// attribute: the 500 ms s3_loss_cur window was still holding genuine
// pre-demote (old-rung) loss entries when the 300 ms gate opened, and the
// arrival tracker still books those -- it just (i) stamps them ~80 ms
// earlier, so more have aged out of the window by the time the gate opens,
// (ii) contributes no entries from the boundary-open interval, and (iii)
// dilutes them faster with post-close current entries. The residual
// exposure that left -- old-rung util entries surviving up to 500 ms into
// the new rung while the in-regime confirm is fade.confirm_ms (100 ms);
// bench campaign 2 (8 pulses, docs/arrival-loss-findings-2026-09-05.md)
// showed zero re-fires, but the control arm also showed none -- is what
// flight 0026 then showed in every 5->0 cascade, hence (3). Observability
// windows (pool_resid*, s1_loss, s3_loss) stay untouched -- they report,
// they don't decide.
