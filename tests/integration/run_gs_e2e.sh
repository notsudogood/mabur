# here instead (magic, ver, type, flags, vtx_id, seq, profile,
# fec_overhead_base_x100, fec_overhead_enh_x100, probe_profile --
# RC_VERSION 6, 2026-09-04, made probe_profile a fixed head byte, 0xFF = no
# probe stream; every bump since (7, T_CAL_CMD/T_CAL_RESULT plus a wider
# Telem; 8, relative calibration indices) left the RCF layout alone and moved
# only the version byte. encode_profile and the CRC are unversioned.
# So read that byte from the header rather than pinning it: as a literal it
# half-landed the RC_VERSION 8 bump (2026-09-13) -- this script kept packing
# 7, maburd dropped the RCF as a foreign peer's, the shed of sid 1 never
# lifted, and the lost enhance stream read as a decoder bug.
