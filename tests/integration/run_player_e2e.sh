# Golden for PART C below: sha256 of the ARGB dump produced by the pinned
# synthetic-font + canned-snapshot render. Regenerate ONLY when a deliberate
# change to the OSD sizing/blitting rules makes the old pixels wrong -- run
# the --osd-render command below by hand and paste the printed hash.
OSD_SHA_EXPECTED=e202e5d127467752984bda2c135d166661f8c0eb2c8481a77d54b39ed8f76a83
# Golden for PART D below. Same rule as OSD_SHA_EXPECTED: to re-bless after
# an intentional visual change, run the --gs-render command below by hand
# and paste the hash. Pinned against the SYNTHETIC font on purpose -- hashing
# the 13 MB shipped .gfont would make a font bump look like a rendering
# regression. A re-bless needs a PIXEL DIFF against the old dump, not just a
# hash swap: the geometry floor below cannot see a single-field blanking, a
# pre/post value transposition, or a pure recolour.
#
# Re-blessed 2026-08-04 (was c311690a...): the FPS baseline was derived from
# the WRONG atlas's cell height, which left the hero FPS box overlapping the
# JIT/MBPS box -- by exactly 0 px with the synthetic font, and by 1..3 px
# with the real one (tests/test_gs_asset.cpp). Diff verified: the FPS value
# and label translate up exactly 8 px and NOTHING else on the 1920x1080
# surface changes (0 differing px outside the FPS cell band, 0 lit px left in
# the vacated rows, lit-pixel total identical at 74690).
#
# Re-blessed 2026-08-04 (was 6479dbb1...): the per-card RSSI box was sized for
# the 11-glyph unheard string instead of the widest numeric, leaving ~160 px of
# dead space between the value and "dBm" on every heard row (visible on the
# bench screen). Pixel diff old->new: 14,344 px differ, bbox x 362..640
# y 924..1022, ZERO differing px outside the card rows, lit total unchanged at
# 74,690 -- i.e. a pure 116 px leftward translation of dBm/SNR in both rows,
# with no glyph added, removed or recoloured.
#
# Re-blessed 2026-08-31 (was 908affc9...): Task 12 (spec
# 2026-08-30-latency-accounting) added the OSD LAT row, a new field this
# harness's --gs-render invocation has no CLI flag to populate, so it always
# renders "LAT --" here. Pixel diff old->new: 3,224 px differ, ALL of them
# NEW ink (lit total 74,690 -> 77,914, delta == diff count exactly, so
# nothing existing moved, changed colour, or was erased), bbox x 1007..1096
# y 858..893 -- a small isolated region above the FPS block (LAT stacks
# above FPS in the video-figures column, see gs_overlay.cpp), matching
# nothing but the new field's own box. No other block's pixels differ.
#
# Re-blessed 2026-09-06 (was 3d926998...): commit 6709053 collapsed the LAT
# block to three right-flush rows (RTT / P50 / P99) sharing one right edge and
# dropped the per-segment breakdown column, so the two LAT rows this harness
# renders as placeholders changed from "P50 --"/"P99 --" left-anchored in the
# old head column to "LAT P50 --"/"LAT P99 --" flushed right. Pixel diff
# old->new: 16,928 px differ, ALL of them inside the two LAT row bands
# (y 812..847 and y 858..893); the surface is byte-identical everywhere else,
# so the RTT row above and the FPS/JIT/MBPS block below did not move. Per row:
# 3,224 px erased at x 993..1082, 5,240 px added at x 1607..1752, ZERO px
# recoloured and ZERO change in vertical extent -- a rightward translation plus
# the "LAT " prefix each row absorbed from the deleted label column. Lit total
# 84,362 -> 88,394 (delta 4,032 == added - erased exactly).
#
# The preceding commit fc44c70 (per-card EVM) is NOT in this delta: rebuilt and
# rendered, it still hashes 3d926998..., because the fixture's cards carry no
# EVM and that field blanks.
GS_SHA_EXPECTED=77352a37acfdda3260ae167c060efc0a232b0e0ec5c52cba2a44c30292f7e511
# Golden for PART E, the compact bar (osd.gs.style = "compact"). Same rule
# as the two above: re-bless only from a pixel diff, never from a hash swap
# alone -- the geometry floor below sees a bar that moved or lost a row, but
# not a transposed value pair or a blanked field.
#
# Re-blessed 2026-09-08 (was 27566469...): the recording indicator moved out
# of row 0 and up to the TOP-RIGHT corner, on its own. Row 0 goes back to
# exactly the pixels it had before the indicator existed (d4cc28b3's row 0),
# row 1 is untouched, and the only new ink is the indicator's own band at
# the top inset -- which is what the third band the gate now asserts is.
#
# Re-blessed 2026-09-08 (was d4cc28b3...): the bar gained the recording
# indicator, rendered identically to the essential overlay's (dot, REC,
# mm:ss clock), and this invocation now passes --rec recording so the pixel
# path covers it.
#
# Re-blessed 2026-09-08 (was f5c5b69c...): the bar went from one row to two.
# A single line capped the type at 22 px on a 1080p panel -- too small to
# read on the GS screen -- and splitting the eleven items across two rows
# (radio above, picture below) lets the same "largest baked size that fits"
# rule pick 38 px instead. Every pixel moves, so a diff against the old dump
# says nothing; what was checked instead is the geometry floor below (two
# bands, both centred, block hugging the bottom) plus the per-row strings
# pinned in tests/test_gs_compact.cpp.

# PPS/IDR/TRAIL) so framing/FEC/AU-grouping all round-trip byte-exact --

# valid HEVC syntax (e.g. the IDR access unit's own slice references a PPS

# NAL/VPS/SPS/PPS on *any* open of this file (exhaustively verified --
# -count_packets vs -count_frames, minimal probesize, even a bare open with
# no -show_entries at all: same errors every time), so a blanket
# empty-stderr assertion is unattainable here regardless of which ffprobe
# invocation is used. This gate therefore tolerates exactly that known,
# bitstream-level noise (grep -iv 'vps|sps|pps|nal|hevc') and fails on
# anything else -- container/box-level complaints (moov/moof/trun), I/O
# errors, demuxer failures -- so it stays a real container-integrity check
