# Cross-build maburgs for ARM (aarch64) / musl, fully static. maburplay is
# built twice: once here (stage 5, musl-static, kept as the maburplay-static
# rollback) and again in stage 6 against the Buildroot glibc toolchain that
# builds the GS image itself, since its burned-DVR colortrans stage links
# Mesa EGL/GLESv2/GBM + librga, which exist only as glibc shared objects.
#
# RUN THIS SCRIPT BARE. Do NOT wrap it in the `nix-shell -p pkg-config
# libusb1` that CLAUDE.md's Build & Test section prescribes for HOST
# cmake/ctest invocations -- that wrapper does not apply here. When libusb1
# is present in the shell, Nix's pkg-config wrapper overrides
# PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR unconditionally, which leaks the host's libusb into
# stage 6's Buildroot-sysroot build underneath it. Stage 6 below detects
# this and fails loudly rather than let CMake surface a confusing
# path-does-not-exist error instead.
#
# Deviations from the original Bootlin-based plan (see
# .superpowers/sdd/task-16-brief.md and task-16-report.md for the full
# rationale): this host is NixOS, where prebuilt toolchains like Bootlin's
# are dynamically linked against /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 — a path that
# does not exist on NixOS, so the downloaded compiler cannot even execute.
# Instead this script uses Nix's own cross stdenv
# (pkgsCross.aarch64-multiplatform.pkgsStatic), which targets
# aarch64-unknown-linux-musl and works natively on NixOS. It also
# provides a prebuilt *static* libusb1 for that target, so — unlike the
# draft — this script does NOT configure/build libusb from source; it just
# resolves the Nix package and points pkg-config at it.
#
# Both the compiler and libusb are realized via `nix-build` with an output
# symlink under toolchain/ (gitignored). That symlink is a GC root, so the
# store paths survive `nix-collect-garbage` between runs and re-running this
# script is a fast no-op (nix-build short-circuits, cmake/make do incremental
# rebuilds).
